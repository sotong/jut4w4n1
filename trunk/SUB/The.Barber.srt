0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000

1
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:34,800
Help me.

2
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,503
Let me out.

3
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,432
Sir...

4
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,302
please let me go.

5
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,838
You don't have to do this.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,741
I won't tell anybody. Just...

7
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,480
No. Let me out!

8
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,348
Let me go!

9
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,817
Let me out.

10
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,654
Let me out!

11
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,058
No!

12
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,295
Our top story tonight,

13
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,996
Chicago police
continue to search

14
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,331
for a missing schoolteacher.

15
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,868
Debra Ann Skokie,
last seen on Tuesday leaving...

16
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,508
A police department spokeswoman

17
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,177
announced the formation
of a special unit task force

18
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,012
in conjunction with the FBI

19
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,214
to investigate
the recent disappearances of...

20
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,153
I'm standing outside
the Chicago Police Department,

21
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,188
where, moments ago,
detectives announced

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,058
they've taken Francis
Allen Visser into custody.

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,060
Visser has been
a person of interest

24
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:11,063
in the murder of
Irene Burge and Katie Pallick.

25
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,631
The bodies were found...

26
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,914
In a shocking development today

27
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,149
Francis Allen Visser,

28
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,050
a suspect in the terrifying
burial murders

29
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,286
of several young women
in the Chicago area,

30
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,688
was released
from custody this morning.

31
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,123
There is speculation

32
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,392
that lead investigator
Detective Thomas McCormack

33
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,628
may be facing
disciplinary action

34
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,662
for the possible tampering

35
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,824
of evidence found
at the scene of the crime.

36
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,233
A spokesperson for
Internal Affairs has stated,

37
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,402
"We are no longer
pursuing Mr. Visser

38
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,337
at this point
in the investigation."

39
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,373
When asked if he
would file sui t

40
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,041
against the Chicago
Police Department,

41
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,142
his attorneys stated, "No.

42
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,111
He just wants
his old life back."

43
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,979
Detective McCormack
declined to comment.

44
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,917
A press conference
is scheduled for later today.

45
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,354
Luis.

46
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,890
Luis, how many times
do I have to tell you

47
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,225
to clean out your station?

48
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,230
I'm gone, Eugene.

49
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,999
Use your head tonight, son.

50
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,134
Come on, Gene, baby.
It's Friday night,

51
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,269
ladies are waiting,

52
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,605
and I already got
my shit worked up.

53
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,040
Please don't use
that kind of language.

54
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,942
You might impress your friends

55
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,277
with talk like that,

56
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,046
but...

57
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,282
Man's legacy is all he has.

58
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,318
Gene...

59
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,888
when you gonna let me
have that razor?

60
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,958
Well, I said I would, Luis,

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,027
when I see you're
careful with what

62
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,161
you leave behind.

63
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,164
Hey, you ain't my dad, Eugene.

64
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,299
Heh.
Know what, man?

65
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,068
You need to get out,
something.

66
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,236
I mean, would it kill you

67
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,071
to come hang out, man?
Drink a beer.

68
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,973
Have yourself a little mamacita.

69
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,042
Get your little dance on.

70
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,777
Well, you know
how I feel about that.

71
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,678
Come on.

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,214
Alcohol says something
about a man

73
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,882
before he gets
a chance to say anything

74
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:44,650
about himself.

75
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,385
I know.

76
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,353
It says he's having fun.

77
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,757
On that note, peace out.

78
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,567
Yeah.

79
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,402
Hoyt.
How you doing?

80
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,072
Hey, Eugene,
come here once.

81
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:41,074
Hey, Davey.

82
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,143
Davey over here right
now was just saying

83
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,646
that with a haircut,
I would look younger.

84
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,082
Well, you know,
it's a barbershop, Chief,

85
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,249
not a time machine.

86
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,954
Hey, Gene, you know,
I really appreciate

87
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,055
what you're doing,

88
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,423
you know, taking an interest

89
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,524
in Luis like that.

90
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,660
Train a child up
in the way of the Lord,

91
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,261
and he won't depart
from Him.

92
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,030
Yeah. And when he does,

93
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,032
he'll get
my helping hand, huh?

94
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,135
You come by anytime, Chief.
Right.

95
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,703
Get those ears lowered.

96
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,504
Yeah.

97
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,239
Hey, guys, how you doing?

98
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,968
Howdy, Mr. V-Dub.

99
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,404
How are things?
Working nights this week.

100
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,406
You know, I got that long
drive back to Brule.

101
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,174
Should have went
to college, you know.

102
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,110
Like I don't know
what you want.

103
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,980
Okay, then.
Good enough.

104
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,317
Hi.

105
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,519
Snuck in on me.
Mm-hmm.

106
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,887
Can I get you
some coffee?

107
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,089
You know, I never
really liked coffee.

108
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,190
What else you got?

109
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,925
Some good things
on that menu.

110
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,126
Have you taken a look?

111
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,128
I haven't.

112
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,262
What are you
in the mood for?

113
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,696
Something sweet.

114
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,632
Stay here.
I'll surprise you.

115
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,689
You know,
you're taller than I thought.

116
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,524
Older, too,
but I bet you can

117
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,426
still handle your shit
if you had to, right?

118
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,395
Do I know you?

119
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:45,864
Eugene Van Wingerdt,
the barber.

120
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,098
Yeah.

121
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,035
It's not your real name,
though, is it, Mr. Visser?

122
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,069
Your mistake.

123
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,839
Damn, the poise on you.

124
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,208
Look, I know they
had to kick you loose.

125
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,643
Lack of evidence, no witnesses,
no fingerprints, nothing.

126
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,079
17 bodies, that's a lot
to walk away from.

127
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,081
Excuse me.

128
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,381
Oh, come on,
Mr. V-Dub.

129
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,151
Chicago P.D.
wouldn't let live it down,

130
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,686
had you pegged a murderer.

131
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,521
God, I bet it was real tough
trying to buy groceries

132
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:10,889
after your face had been plaste
red all over the news.

133
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,257
I'll give you
whatever you want.

134
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,358
Please, please,
don't kill me.

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,026
Dude, I don't want
to kill you.

136
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,361
I'm trying to impress you.

137
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,030
Impressed?

138
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,867
Gene! Are you okay?!

139
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,568
Stop!

140
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,038
Freeze!

141
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,647
You got no I.D.,

142
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,184
and, uh, this name
you gave me,

143
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,119
John D. LaRue,

144
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,322
well, you know, that just
doesn't show up anywhere.

145
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,224
Nowhere.

146
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,159
I mean, it's not in the DMV,

147
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,595
not in Social Security,
not in the library system.

148
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,831
I look like I got
a fucking library card?

149
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,965
Oh, no.

150
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,535
Looks like you're
giving me a false name.

151
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,638
So, uh...

152
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,042
when'd you get into town?

153
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,512
Okay. Okay.

154
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,847
You know, uh...

155
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:13,885
I'm not some rube
from the sticks, asshole.

156
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,123
I'm Kenosha P.D.,
12 years.

157
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,225
Holy shit, Kenosha.

158
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,526
Yeah.
Yeah.

159
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,028
Is this a promotion?

160
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,764
Okay.

161
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,236
So tell me a story.

162
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,505
Tell me the one about the guy o
utside of Heidebreicht's,

163
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,640
the guy
you poked with that.

164
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:36,642
I thought I knew him.

165
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,343
And who is that,

166
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,178
the guy
you thought you knew?

167
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,313
My old man.

168
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,814
Fucker up and left
when I was a kid.

169
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,383
Guy in the diner,
spitting fucking image.

170
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,385
Followed him out,
asked him his name.

171
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,687
The guy freaks his shit.

172
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,388
And so you thought
you'd get some blood

173
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,223
for a paternity test?

174
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,729
Yeah. Uh...

175
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,833
well, the guy
you poked with that,

176
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,436
he's a real good friend
of mine,

177
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,605
so I need to know
why his blood's

178
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,340
on your fucking knife.

179
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,377
Daddy likes it rough.

180
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,121
Chief,
Eugene's out front.

181
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,091
Uhh!

182
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,831
Gene, are you okay?

183
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,299
I mean,
we've been calling.

184
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,034
I'm fine. Man, oh, man.

185
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,470
I must have made
a spectacle of myself

186
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,938
running away like that.

187
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,673
Yeah. Yeah, we were
worried about you.

188
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,875
You get anyone
to look at that for you?

189
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,243
Nah, I'm...
You know, it's nothing.

190
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,647
T-That fellow you brought in,
did he say anything?

191
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,550
Oh, he... he spouted
some bunk story.

192
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,585
What story?

193
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,387
He thought
you were his father.

194
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,454
And it's bullshit.

195
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,690
This kid,
he'll say anything.

196
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,091
I want you to let him go.
What?

197
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,426
I mean,
he didn't hurt me. He...

198
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,261
Well, he stuck a knife
in you, Gene.

199
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,430
No, no more
charity cases.

200
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,633
Wait.

201
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,002
Is he yours?

202
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,405
I'm not
gonna press charges.

203
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,109
You don't have
to press charges.

204
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,683
Gary, we've been friends
a long time.

205
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,252
I never asked
for a favor.

206
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,487
I'm asking for one now.

207
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,291
Please let the kid go.
Please.

208
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,235
You got a problem,
man?

209
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,307
Get in the truck.

210
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,244
Am I gonna be
number 18?

211
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,279
Get in the truck.

212
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,281
Okay.

213
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,725
Hey, this is
a great dump site.

214
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,161
Isolated,
off the highway.

215
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:16,995
This yours?

216
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,664
Bring me out here
to show me?

217
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,766
You told the Chief
of Police you thought

218
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,867
I was your father.

219
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,135
What's wrong with you?

220
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,637
That loyal prick thinks
you're a saint.

221
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,704
Why would you say that?

222
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,706
Cops liked you
for a bunch

223
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,974
of those missing
girls, right?

224
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,776
But they couldn't
make it stick.

225
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:32,877
My favorites
were the ones you

226
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,145
put in the ground.

227
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,148
I've never been involved
in any kind of violence.

228
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,085
Come on. Scratch marks
in those pine lids.

229
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,787
I want to know
how you picked them.

230
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,156
What's the trigger?
What's the thing,

231
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,759
goes click in your head, this
one, not that one?

232
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,561
Debbie Ann Skokie,
your first, why...

233
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,196
If I am who you think I am,

234
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,264
why wouldn't I
just kill you right now

235
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,333
and bury you up here
where nobody would

236
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,034
ever find you?

237
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,736
I'm not who you think I am.

238
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:02,106
I'm not, so please
stop this, please.

239
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,210
Mr. Visser,
I know who you are,

240
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,111
because I'm
your biggest fan.

241
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,947
I get it.
You're laying low.

242
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,915
You're, uh...
You're taking a break.

243
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:16,287
But I know that
that itch doesn't die.

244
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,256
I know. I live with it.

245
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,859
And if I'm gonna
learn anything about

246
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,627
who I am and what I am,

247
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,062
it's gonna be from you,

248
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,730
a man with
your experience,

249
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,032
because you and me,
we are the same.

250
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,135
I looked for you
everywhere for so long.

251
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:35,707
What happened in Chicago
was a horrible mistake.

252
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,041
They let me go.

253
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,776
They let you go
because you're the best.

254
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,746
They let me go
because they had the wrong man.

255
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,947
It's cold.

256
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,184
Go downhill
to the highway,

257
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,452
Highway 2.

258
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,487
Someone will
pick you up.

259
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,588
You leave me alone!

260
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,623
You brought me here
to leave me?

261
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,790
What the fuck
are you doing?

262
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,292
Get the fuck
out of the car.

263
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,628
Visser! Visser.

264
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,998
What the fuck?

265
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,005
Monday morning...

266
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,463
Shit, man, you okay?

267
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,234
Kelli, right?

268
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,835
Yeah.

269
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,471
I saw you
get arrested back there.

270
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,206
That sucks.
Yeah, right?

271
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,841
Do you want
to use my phone?

272
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,109
Do you need
to call somebody?

273
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,412
Take a ride into town
if you could.

274
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,314
Yeah, come on.

275
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,151
I been trying to leave
this spank-ass town

276
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,719
for, like,
two years now.

277
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,121
Place like this,
they notice everything.

278
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,723
They stare at me
like I'm a freak.

279
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,526
I just want
to move to the city,

280
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:05,763
you know,
be anonymous.

281
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,732
Guess I just need
somebody to kick me

282
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,067
in my big old butt.

283
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,403
Do you always
take this highway home?

284
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,472
Yep. There's no cops.

285
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,840
I speed.

286
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,761
Hey, it's me again.

287
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,997
Where the hell are you?

288
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,232
Just call me back, okay?

289
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,176
Hey, baby.

290
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,945
You working the phones
or the corner?

291
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,046
Sorry, tiger.

292
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,015
My mind must be
wandering tonight.

293
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,050
Your, uh, mind
gonna be wandering

294
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,251
during the middle
of my session?

295
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,587
40 bucks,
and we'll find out.

296
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,513
Come on.
Hey.

297
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,065
We have a strict
touch-and-go policy.

298
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,100
You touch. I go.

299
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,635
That's the point.

300
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,637
Okay.

301
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,943
I got something special
for a special fella like you.

302
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,779
C.P.D., motherfucker.

303
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,680
You're under arrest.

304
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,062
Where'd you get those?

305
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,997
Your little bag
of tricks, you perv.

306
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,599
Okay.

307
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,370
Going through my shit?

308
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,005
I didn't
go through your shit.

309
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,874
They were sitting right on top.
I grabbed them.

310
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,282
Sit down with me.

311
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,562
Relax. This is
supposed to be fun.

312
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,695
That's okay.

313
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,664
So this is
gonna be fun?

314
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,565
Mm.

315
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,501
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

316
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,942
That's the fun part.

317
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,388
Come on.

318
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,702
Nod your head if you think this
was fucking stupid.

319
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,871
That yes?

320
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,844
Man, I just
gave you a ride.

321
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:47,979
We're cool, right?

322
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,181
Stranger, motel,

323
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,650
middle of the night.

324
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,355
What the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

325
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,729
What? Who is this?

326
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,487
What?

327
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,389
You would have
done it better, right?

328
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,225
I mean, of course...
of course you would.

329
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,927
I know. I kinda...

330
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,896
I know. I made a mess.

331
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,065
It's, uh... You know,

332
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,933
it got a little sloppy,
but, I mean,

333
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,268
I passed your test,
right?

334
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,336
What test?

335
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,371
You told me
go down the highway.

336
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,405
"Someone
will pick you up."

337
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,707
You said
take Highway 2.

338
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,475
You said that, right?
You said that.

339
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,377
You were trying
to tell me that... Look.

340
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,145
You knew she'd be
out there, and you knew

341
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,280
that I would find her,

342
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,282
and you put me in the
perfect fucking spot.

343
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:33,517
Right? Right?

344
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:41,959
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,494
Look,
I get it. Okay?

346
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,763
You can't trust me.
Why would you?

347
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:48,632
I just showed up out of the blu
e
threatened you.

348
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,301
Yeah, why would you
tell me your deepest

349
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,502
and darkest, unless...

350
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,438
unless I got a rope around my
neck, too, right?

351
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,706
Well, now I do.

352
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,542
I mean, bringing me
in the woods like that,

353
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,745
that was
fucking brilliant.

354
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,814
You wanted to see
if I wanted it, right?

355
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,818
What do you want from me?

356
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,421
I just...
I know there's more,

357
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,790
like there's
something else,

358
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,292
there's something
that I can't come up

359
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,560
with on my own.

360
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,464
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

361
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,413
Who saw you come in?

362
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,248
What? N-Nobody.

363
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,582
Grace, the manager.

364
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,518
Nobody fucking saw me.

365
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,387
Never use
that kind of language.

366
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,689
I don't want to hear it
out of your mouth.

367
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,192
Can you
take care of this?

368
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,061
You mean, like,
to get rid of the body?

369
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,596
Can you get it
squared away?

370
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,098
Yes, sir. No problem.

371
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,037
Come by the shop tomorrow.

372
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,874
Okay.

373
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,381
Hey, I'm at your place.

374
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,317
Where are you?

375
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,018
What's going on?

376
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,223
Dick.

377
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,833
Hello?

378
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,103
John?

379
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,218
It's a good look for you.

380
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,123
Very good.

381
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,157
That sure... You like it?

382
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,807
What the...

383
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,380
Oh, my God.

384
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,683
Fuck. Shit.

385
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,990
What?

386
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,737
Jesus.

387
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,311
God.

388
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,196
Captain,
it's Detective Bennett.

389
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,498
Can we meet?

390
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,400
It's about McCormack.

391
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,975
The best haircut
I never paid for.

392
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,710
It's always
a pleasure, sir.

393
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:02,312
Well, next time,
I'm getting a Mohawk.

394
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,650
I don't think
I remember how to do

395
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:07,751
one of those things.

396
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,254
Be careful out there.

397
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,016
Yeah, you be good.
Okay.

398
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,430
So he pay you this time?

399
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,532
Eh, Chief risks
his life every day.

400
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,168
Haircut's
the least I can do.

401
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,469
Cheap-ass fucker.

402
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,237
Eh, there you go again.

403
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,817
Yo, yo.

404
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,486
What's up, man?
Welcome.

405
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:43,987
You need a cut?

406
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,629
Yours, Eugene?
Come on, man.

407
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,732
'Cause if he's a walk-in,
I gotta get paid.

408
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,767
What's up, baby?
I got you right here, bro.

409
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,769
Nah, I'm here for Eugene.

410
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,370
He's mine.

411
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,474
Man, this is bullshit.

412
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:04,675
Come on.

413
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,343
Hey, Luis,
do me a favor.

414
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,245
Go over
to Heidebreicht's.

415
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,379
Get me a cup
of coffee.

416
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,647
Excuse me?

417
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,549
And get one
for my client, too.

418
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,584
Black.

419
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,785
Yeah. Why don't
I go wash

420
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,153
your goddamn truck
while I'm at it?

421
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,821
What did you just say?
Come on, Gene.

422
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,823
I mean, who died and made me yo
ur fucking slave, man?

423
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:20,991
Shut your
filthy mouth.

424
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,159
Jeez, calm down,
man. Whatever.

425
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:25,262
No, no, not whatever.
Not whatever.

426
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,232
The answer is, "Yes, sir,
Mr. Van Wingerdt."

427
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,500
I am your boss,

428
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:32,102
your boss
in this place of business.

429
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,670
Maybe you should
just get the coffee.

430
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,405
Maybe you should
shut the fuck up.

431
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:36,740
That's it.
Get out of here.

432
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,242
Whoa. No, no, no.
Hold on, man.

433
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,410
You got a foul mouth.
I'm tired of hearing it.

434
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,578
Eugene, look, I'm sorry.
No.

435
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,646
Mr. Van Wingerdt,
I'm sorry, okay?

436
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,181
You had your chance.
No sorry.

437
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,049
Look, you know I've got a bad
temper. Man, come on.

438
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,051
No. You had
your chance. No.

439
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,353
Seriously?

440
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:50,521
Yeah.

441
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,640
Why do you let yourself
look like that?

442
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,775
What? What do you mean?

443
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,477
You look like a bum.

444
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,812
Hah.

445
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,815
I'm not saying dress
to the nines either.

446
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:21,251
A man's appearance
should always show

447
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,553
self-respect,

448
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,922
never self-importance.
Hmm.

449
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:27,891
That's how you stayed
under the radar.

450
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,994
I'm trying
to tell you how a man

451
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,397
should live his life.

452
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,965
Be clean. Don't rush.

453
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,301
That leads to mistakes.

454
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,136
And...

455
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,971
pay attention
to the details.

456
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:44,007
Gene Van Wingerdt,
pleasure.

457
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:45,943
John LaRue.

458
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,511
School starts
tomorrow, son.

459
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,420
Hey, Cap!

460
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,055
Aw, shit, Bennett.

461
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,823
I'm late for my grandkid's
birthday party.

462
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,192
John's gone looking
for a man named

463
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,227
Francis A. Visser.

464
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,429
He's going by
Eugene Van Wingerdt now.

465
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,331
He's working as a barber
out in Moraine,

466
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,533
the same guy that you
and his father arrested.

467
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,801
I know who Visser is.

468
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:13,437
And Thomas McCormack?

469
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,938
Tom was
a great detective

470
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,207
and the best man
I ever knew.

471
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,209
He got obsessed
with this Visser case.

472
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,511
He worked 24/7
and drank himself sick,

473
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,913
and this...
this McCormack, Jr.,

474
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,716
I'm pretty sure he's
in that same brain lack.

475
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,918
Well, maybe John
found something new.

476
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,786
He's convinced
the man is guilty.

477
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,855
So was his Paps.

478
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,190
Tom's cop gut
had him convinced

479
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,025
he always brought in
the right guy.

480
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,526
He became
the worst cop possible.

481
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,895
He went so deep
into that darkness

482
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,963
that he'd never
see the light again.

483
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,665
You know what he did?

484
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:44,301
He shot himself
in the fucking head.

485
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,171
John said he was killed
in the line.

486
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,473
Yeah, well,
I guess our boy has

487
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,108
a distorted view of the past,
doesn't he?

488
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,176
No, I need
to bring him back.

489
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,711
He's off
the fucking payroll.

490
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:55,913
He's off
the goddamn reservation.

491
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,315
He's a loose cannon.

492
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,918
Look, kid, I know that
he had a rough time,

493
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,753
but he has made
his choice, Audrey,

494
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,622
and if you go after him,

495
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,057
then you're
off my ranks, too.

496
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,592
The way it is, kid.

497
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,520
Last bell's rung.

498
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,555
Tardy.

499
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,025
How'd you get in here?

500
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,562
Eh, Grace, the manager,

501
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,931
we go to the same church.

502
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,466
Where'd you get that?

503
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,770
This? From a cop.

504
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,572
He gave it to you?

505
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,642
Yeah. He fucking
gave it to me.

506
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,845
Grace saw you
leave with Kelli,

507
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,747
Mr. Smart-mouth.

508
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,048
Really?

509
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,751
Heh.

510
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,523
No more smoking.

511
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,230
What, you never
had a bad habit?

512
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:25,736
Listen,
everywhere you go,

513
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:29,006
you are leaving
puzzle pieces

514
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,375
for anyone
who's looking.

515
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,418
Up and at 'em,
slugabed.

516
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,721
We're going shopping
for school clothes.

517
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,931
Have I told you I have
a keen interest in birds?

518
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,900
They're such
delicate creatures.

519
00:33:56,902 --> 00:34:00,337
See that little birdie
over there?

520
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,672
Been watching her
for quite a while.

521
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,375
I followed her
so many times.

522
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,644
We've been
as close as this.

523
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:08,646
Size 16, right?

524
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,247
Yep.
Thanks a bunch.

525
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,448
Mm-hmm.

526
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,117
She don't recognize me.

527
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,987
She thinks she only knows me
from here in the store.

528
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,489
I want you to follow her.

529
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,827
And then I want you
to kill her.

530
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,263
Forget it.

531
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:27,564
Listen.
No, no, no.

532
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,598
Listen to me.

533
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,766
I already
passed this test.

534
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,334
In your mind,

535
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,870
count how many times
you could have done it.

536
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,272
And don't
make something up.

537
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,808
I know where she goes
and what she does.

538
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,811
Show me
you can be white noise.

539
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:43,447
You do that,
and I'll tell you

540
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,417
how I got Debbie Ann
to eat out of my hand.

541
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,719
She's off at 2:00.

542
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,232
So wait. Wait.

543
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,101
She... She still doesn't
lock that sliding door?

544
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,103
Test's over.

545
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,038
You'd be surprised
what people don't see.

546
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,507
I mean, they just
never consider

547
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,041
there's somebody
out there watching.

548
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,277
Mm-hmm.
I get close

549
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:50,147
and wait for that one...

550
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,215
unguarded moment.

551
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,018
Debbie Ann.

552
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,621
Debbie Ann was
easy to notice.

553
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,523
I watched her for weeks,

554
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,825
just thinking
about the whole thing,

555
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,894
just dreaming
about doing it.

556
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:05,695
And I see...

557
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:10,767
this pretty, yummy girl,

558
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:14,571
eh, thin red lips,

559
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:18,441
thin line between
white trash and whore.

560
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,611
And I think,
"Everything's easy

561
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,512
for her."

562
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:28,118
And it just filled me
with rage...

563
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,389
and lust.

564
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,523
And...

565
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,062
when I was done,

566
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,665
when I finished,

567
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:49,039
I left her Bible open
to Hebrews 9:22.

568
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,874
"There can be
no forgiveness

569
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,043
without the shedding
of blood."

570
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:57,280
It's not too original,
but I got better.

571
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,082
You never forget
your first, huh?

572
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,218
Or your last.

573
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,320
Great work
with Judy Lynn today.

574
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,422
Tomorrow's my day off.

575
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:08,225
Got another field trip
in mind.

576
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,800
How many truck stops
do we have in this country?

577
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,069
Thousands,

578
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,037
and every one of them

579
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,608
crawling
with ungodly yummies.

580
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,444
This is the insider info
that you're giving up?

581
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,312
Nope. I'm trying
to show you

582
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:30,680
the watch trick.

583
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:31,948
The what?

584
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,883
The watch trick.

585
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,152
See, now, looky here.

586
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,755
That little birdie
has just come off

587
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,823
a long shift.

588
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,726
All she wants
is to get home,

589
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,394
put on some sweats,

590
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,897
and watch a little
reality TV with her cat.

591
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,234
It's raining like crazy.

592
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,437
You pull up and ask her
if she'd like a ride home

593
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,239
or at least,
you know, somewhere

594
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,241
out of the rain.

595
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,309
She knows she shouldn't.

596
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,144
She'll want to say,
"No, thank you."

597
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,245
Mm-hmm.

598
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:05,415
And that's
when you do this.

599
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,156
That's the watch trick?

600
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,958
You're late.

601
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,593
Mm-hmm.
You got places to go.

602
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,928
You just stopped
out of the kindness

603
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,896
of your heart

604
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,931
to get her
out of the rain.

605
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,038
Who'd you use this on?

606
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,572
No more out of me

607
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:33,576
till I see you get
that girl into this truck.

608
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,322
Hi.
Hey.

609
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,157
You look like you want
to get out of the rain.

610
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,725
You want a... You want
a ride somewhere dry?

611
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,126
No, it's cool.
One of my friends

612
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,161
is gonna come get me.

613
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:51,961
That's kinda
why I stopped.

614
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,129
I barely got through.

615
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,098
They closed the road down
because of the rain.

616
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,167
Shit.

617
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,335
Come on.
You're getting soaked.

618
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,004
Um, no, i-it's fine.

619
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,006
Thank you.

620
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,010
Okay.

621
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,144
Wait, are... Wait.

622
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:11,081
Uh, are you sure
you don't mind?

623
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,850
Yeah. No, really, I don't.

624
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,352
It's not a big deal.

625
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,854
Okay. Thanks.

626
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,584
I'm not done.

627
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,586
Coffee's
from those fellas.

628
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,088
Said black, right?

629
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,291
That right, bro?

630
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,494
Bet you ain't saying
anything now, huh?

631
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,506
I got your "fuck you"
right here, man.

632
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,850
Let me tell you
something, bro.

633
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,819
You see, I've
been pushing a broom

634
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:23,821
two years over there,

635
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:27,624
you know, laughing
at his fucking jokes

636
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:28,458
and shit.

637
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,360
What, you appearing
out of nowhere,

638
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:31,327
and suddenly
I'm on the outside

639
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:34,764
looking in?
- Nah, fuck that, man.

640
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,965
I'm in line
for that shop.

641
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,134
Ah, you...
- Hey, hey, hey.

642
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,335
Fuck you
gonna do, huh?

643
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,204
I know you got me fired, right,
bitch?

644
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,006
Hey! You ain't doing shit, man.

645
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,073
You ain't
doing shit.

646
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,241
You a pussy.
That's right.

647
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,709
Lucky these
motherfuckers

648
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,611
don't fuck your ass up right
now. What you gonna do?

649
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,814
You're pretty touch
with all your boys, huh?

650
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,382
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

651
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:54,217
What the fuck
you looking at?

652
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,852
You two are fucking adorable,
by the way.

653
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,554
Where you going, bro?
Thank you so much.

654
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:58,822
I'm gonna
go take a piss.

655
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,857
You wanna shake it for me,
you little faggot?

656
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,626
That's right.

657
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,695
Walk away, baby.
Walk away.

658
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,798
Believe this shit?

659
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,134
Punk ass.

660
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,071
Sorry about that.

661
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,257
Van Wingerdt's.

662
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,592
I knew you'd
be there this early.

663
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,760
Yo, I ran into
your boy last night.

664
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,163
I swear, if you hurt him...

665
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,400
Look,
nothing happened. Okay?

666
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,903
But I found something
on him, man.

667
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,506
I don't have time
for this, Luis.

668
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,842
Please, man. Look,
he's not who he says he is.

669
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,747
Look, the last thing
I want is for you to be

670
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:38,948
taken advantage of, man.

671
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,817
I don't know what
you're talking about.

672
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,189
I can come by and show you, Mr.
Van Wingerdt.

673
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,125
One hour.

674
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,927
Cool.

675
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,269
What the fuck?

676
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,271
Fuck.

677
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,341
Oh, shit. Shit.

678
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,181
Shit. Shit. Shit.

679
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,753
No, no! No!

680
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,956
Let's go.
Come on.

681
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,161
Get the fuck down.
Get the fuck down.

682
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,297
Let me see
your fucking hands.

683
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,465
Where's it at, huh?

684
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,267
Where's what, man?
Oh, where's what?

685
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:32,635
You don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about?

686
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:33,870
Where's the badge,
motherfucker?

687
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,304
It's in
my fucking pocket.

688
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:36,472
Oh, it's in your pocket.

689
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,840
I knew you were
a fucking cop, man.

690
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,109
Yeah, you knew I was a cop.
Get the fuck up.

691
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,444
Right over here.

692
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,647
What you running from, baby?

693
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,983
Why didn't you say good-bye
to me last night?

694
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:47,985
Fuck you, man.

695
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:48,785
Oh, fuck me?

696
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,720
You listening yet?

697
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:52,021
You see this?

698
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,057
You're not gonna tell
anybody about this,

699
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,459
not your homies,
not Eugene, nobody.

700
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,732
You know what?
I don't fucking believe you.

701
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,634
I know your type.

702
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:06,335
You say one thing when
you're playing the victim

703
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,371
and another thing when
you get back to the crib.

704
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,906
Maybe you're just forgetful.
I don't know.

705
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,641
I don't know.
But you know what?

706
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:12,775
It makes me fucking sick.
No.

707
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,877
So here's
what we're gonna do.

708
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,279
I'm gonna leave you
with something that

709
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:17,280
you won't forget about it.

710
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,282
Fuck. No, no. I swear...

711
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:19,515
I swear,
f-fucking swear.

712
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,084
I swear to God
I won't say anything.

713
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:22,885
Oh, "I swear to god."
Shut the fuck up. You ready?

714
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,922
You breathe
a word about me,

715
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:28,591
and I will cut your tongue
from your mouth,

716
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,526
and I will fucking
feed it to you.

717
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:31,528
You got me?

718
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:32,595
I got you, man.
I sw...

719
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,696
Are you sure?
Yeah, I...

720
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,898
Are you sure?
I swear to God, man.

721
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,366
I got you.
No, no, please.

722
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:38,801
Please.
I got you, man.

723
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:40,903
I got you.
So you'll fucking remember?

724
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,506
I promise, man.
I swear.

725
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,847
Have a nice fucking day.
Fucking...

726
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,020
Fucking...

727
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,356
Excuse me.

728
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,559
Here we go.

729
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,328
Hey, mister.

730
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,096
Do you know
if this is the way

731
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:07,964
to the Vagabond?

732
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,199
I'm totally
turned around.

733
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,468
Boy, you sure are.

734
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,237
It's east about
a mile and a half.

735
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,571
Want a lift?

736
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,406
Oh, no, it's okay.

737
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,375
I don't mind the walk.

738
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,043
Thanks, though.

739
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:22,812
Come on.

740
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:24,747
I'm headed that way.

741
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:28,084
Really, it's okay.

742
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:29,786
Suit yourself.

743
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:34,657
Sure it's cool, tiger?

744
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,026
No trouble at all.

745
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,469
You should wear
your seatbelt.

746
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,337
Thanks.

747
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,580
Yeah. Can't be
too careful.

748
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,120
Thanks for picking me up.

749
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:05,588
Mm-hmm.

750
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,090
I don't know anyone here.

751
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:11,327
I sure don't mind
making new friends, though.

752
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:16,199
You get lonely out here?

753
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,675
Where we going?

754
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,144
Well, I know a shortcut.

755
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:31,981
You know, we don't have
to go straight to the motel.

756
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,983
We can go wherever you want,

757
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,586
and I'll make you
come real fast.

758
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,391
Today is your lucky day,
young lady.

759
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,493
And why is that?

760
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,863
Because I picked you up.

761
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,467
Well, let's get lucky then,
tiger.

762
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,236
You listen to me.

763
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:55,438
You're a pretty girl,
and this is

764
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,205
a nice town,

765
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,007
but that don't
mean bad people

766
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,075
don't live here.

767
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:03,145
You really
should be more careful.

768
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:04,647
Okay?

769
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:37,647
Look like you had a fight
with a grain thresher.

770
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:40,116
Luis have anything
to do with this?

771
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,052
Why would he?

772
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,354
Is there something you
should be telling me, John?

773
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,889
What did he say?

774
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:49,825
That he had
something to show me.

775
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,093
Know what that was?

776
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,397
Luis is full
of shit, Eugene.

777
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:56,766
If he really had
something to show you,

778
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,367
why didn't he show up
this morning?

779
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,070
Why would he
say those things?

780
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:03,439
He thinks that I'm here
trying to steal his job.

781
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,573
Did he tell you that?

782
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,776
No. Right?

783
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:08,978
See, I have been
on the up-and-up

784
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,980
with you since day one.

785
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,752
How'd you do in the fight?

786
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:19,622
Heh.

787
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,057
I held my own.

788
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,195
Can you drive?

789
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:27,730
Yeah. Yeah.

790
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,265
You'll come
to my place tonight.

791
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,233
You can't take care
of yourself here.

792
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:34,837
No, no, no, no. I'm good.
You don't have to do that.

793
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:38,040
No. I won't take no
for an answer.

794
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:43,846
I've got a vacant room
in... in a big old house

795
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:46,882
with nothing
but dandelions

796
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:50,686
and dust bunnies
taking up residence.

797
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:51,721
Oh.

798
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,091
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't... Don't worry. I'm...

799
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,393
I'll grab my stuff.
It's okay, really.

800
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,963
Let's go by
the shop and get you

801
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,331
cleaned up first.

802
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,768
You've become
like a son to me.

803
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,745
Have a seat.

804
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,959
Didn't your father ever
teach you how to shave?

805
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:32,628
It's one of the few
lessons in life reserved

806
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,130
exclusively for sons.

807
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,870
You never watched him?

808
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,071
He wasn't really around.

809
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,374
Preparation is
very important

810
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,475
in shaving, son.

811
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:51,914
The lather should
always be thick,

812
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,215
never foamy,

813
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:58,454
and always
go on light,

814
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:02,124
never heavy.

815
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,128
You sure you want
to get into this?

816
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,500
I'm here, aren't I?

817
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,335
Yeah. Yeah.

818
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,703
All right.

819
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,742
There was, uh...

820
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,111
There was
this detective once

821
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:24,213
who got it
in his head

822
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,748
I was the guy
for a case

823
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,816
he was working.

824
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:27,818
Mm.

825
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:28,819
Couldn't let it go.

826
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,252
Head back.

827
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,090
So one day,

828
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:37,059
he shows up
out of nowhere,

829
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:38,360
hauls me in,

830
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:41,030
and starts grilling me
about some phone calls.

831
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:42,965
Apparently
this detective had

832
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:44,266
been getting calls

833
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,536
from some... heh...
phantom caller

834
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:51,006
claiming he'd
abducted a woman,

835
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,042
buried her alive.

836
00:51:53,044 --> 00:51:55,311
Relax your face.

837
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,246
So he showed me
the transcripts

838
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,848
of these calls, right,

839
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,684
see how
I'd react to 'em.

840
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:04,687
And this guy
would say things like,

841
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,255
"I took
another one, Tom,

842
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:08,924
"told her not to panic.

843
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:12,128
"If she stays calm,

844
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,263
you have
at least two hours."

845
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:16,432
Every time
another girl

846
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,466
went missing,

847
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,202
he'd get another call
and just...

848
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,771
go into this frenzy,

849
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:24,773
trying to piece
together clues

850
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,242
before it was
too late.

851
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:30,779
This guy would ask him,
"Is that enough time?

852
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,715
You have
all the time you need."

853
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:36,118
I never seen
anyone so angry.

854
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,920
And there
was this one thing

855
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,155
I'll never forget.

856
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:42,858
He says, "You lost
another one, Tom.

857
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,027
"You never
could figure out

858
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:48,497
"how to put your ear
to the ground and

859
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,832
really listen.

860
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:53,102
And the girls,
they never really

861
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:55,271
could stay calm."

862
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:04,180
I guess they went
back and forth like that

863
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:07,283
until this cop
couldn't take it anymore.

864
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:10,052
He knew there was
something odd about me,

865
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,121
and I told him I didn't
know anything about

866
00:53:12,123 --> 00:53:13,355
the calls or the girls,

867
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,224
but he
didn't believe me.

868
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:18,093
He was so sure.

869
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:20,829
'Course they
had nothing hard on me

870
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:22,731
and had to release me.

871
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,767
By that time...

872
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,737
some photographer
had made me famous.

873
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:35,711
And that was
when I decided to...

874
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,049
move up here,

875
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:44,220
start over fresh.

876
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:45,955
Out with the old...

877
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,858
and in with the new.

878
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,227
Would you
look at that?

879
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:55,297
There's a handsome young man
under there.

880
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:02,972
You know,
there are a few things

881
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:06,375
that a man
needs in life...

882
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,447
and a good razor's one.

883
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,948
No, I can't...
I can't take that.

884
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,983
Please.
No, really.

885
00:54:13,985 --> 00:54:15,117
Please.

886
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,286
I really
want you to.

887
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,389
Thank you, Eugene.

888
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:21,924
Don't mention it.

889
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,676
Eh, so it's not
the Ritz. Heh.

890
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,612
It's home.

891
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:55,324
Wow. Heh.

892
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:58,627
It's just
some stuff I had

893
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,095
and stuff I saved.

894
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:01,297
Mm-hmm.

895
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,634
You hungry?

896
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:08,837
Mm, no. Thank you.

897
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,207
Need anything?
Glass of water?

898
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:15,377
Only thing I need is
what you keep not giving me.

899
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:20,582
Well, then, maybe you
should boil it down

900
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:24,353
to what it really is
you're looking for.

901
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,925
They arrested you,
turned you upside down,

902
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,460
and you still
walked away.

903
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:32,761
That's it. That's...
That's all I'm after.

904
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:35,364
I need you to teach me
how to get away with it.

905
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,601
Okay.

906
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,938
But not until
you get some rest.

907
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:45,974
No.

908
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:47,276
Okay.

909
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:50,379
John, I'm really glad
you're here.

910
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:54,116
Heh.
Here for Thanksgiving.

911
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,384
Heh.

912
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,087
Yeah.

913
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,707
Eugene. I need to talk
to the C hief.

914
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,009
Everything okay, Eugene?

915
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:28,510
I want to report
an assault.

916
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:29,978
Damn it, Gene.
Are you talking

917
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,916
Yeah, we had a call
last night about a fight

918
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:35,317
over at the car wash.

919
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:36,618
You know,
maybe that greaseball

920
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,686
Luis didn't start it.

921
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,154
You ever think
about that?

922
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:40,689
Luis didn't start it.
I did.

923
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:43,492
Luis was jealous
as all hell.

924
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,929
I don't want
anything to happen

925
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:48,096
to him, to Luis,

926
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:50,199
but I want it
on record Luis

927
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:52,000
assaulted John first.

928
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,169
Okay. Okay.

929
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:57,306
We'll take care of it.

930
00:57:57,308 --> 00:58:01,076
So, um, where's John now?

931
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,646
What?

932
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,216
You're sitting there,
telling me you don't know

933
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:08,317
where he is?

934
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,586
Yeah, that's what
I'm saying, Gary.

935
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:29,238
I just got a phone call
from Sheriff Pullman.

936
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,839
He's over
in the next county.

937
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,108
They found
the body of a female

938
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,011
torn apart by coyotes
over at Petenwell Lake.

939
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,747
They're still working
on a positive I.D.,

940
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:42,251
but if that
turns out to be Kelli,

941
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:44,319
I'm gonna be doing
a whole lot more

942
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,188
than talking to your friend.

943
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,179
Oh, my God.

944
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,114
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

945
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,749
Oh, my God..
I'm...

946
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,651
Wait, wait. What the fuck
are you doing here?

947
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:51,153
What do you think
I'm doing here?

948
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:52,721
Have you
lost your mind?

949
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:54,289
Do you know
whose house you're in?

950
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,657
This is Visser's house.

951
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:56,992
Yeah, well,
then I'll say hello,

952
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:58,961
because I was with him
this morning.

953
00:59:58,963 --> 00:59:59,963
What?
Yeah.

954
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,029
I hitched a ride.

955
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,998
I gave him every
opportunity to kill me...

956
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,800
Are you...
or fuck me or whatever,

957
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:06,702
and he
took offense, John.

958
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:08,604
He took offense
because he doesn't act

959
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:09,972
on impulse like that.

960
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:11,239
He stakes them out.

961
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:13,508
He plans out
every yummy detail.

962
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,743
Listen to me.

963
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,612
I've read the homicide files,
okay?

964
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:17,679
Uh-huh.
They cut him loose

965
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:18,780
for a reason.

966
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,248
Yeah, because they
didn't have any idea

967
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,451
who they were dealing with, jus
t
like you. No, no.

968
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:23,685
They had no motives,

969
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,654
no prints,
no DNA, nothing.

970
01:00:25,656 --> 01:00:27,322
Yeah, because he's
too smart for that shit.

971
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,390
He's too clever.

972
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:30,025
Okay. So what are you
gonna get him on,

973
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:32,561
what, the candlestick
in the library?

974
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:34,262
I've got him convinced
that I'm a killer, too.

975
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,464
He's been teaching me.

976
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:36,932
I've had to do things.
Oh, my God.

977
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:39,267
I got him this close
to telling me everything.

978
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,037
He's lying to you.

979
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,573
Baby, he's not lying to me.
I'm lying to him.

980
01:00:44,575 --> 01:00:46,108
I'm playing
this motherfucker.

981
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,275
He has a box
of this shit

982
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:48,210
in his basement.

983
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,444
What do you mean?

984
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,046
It's a front, John, okay?
Uh-hu h.

985
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,081
He's playing a part,
just like you.

986
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,117
You didn't hear.
You didn't hear the way

987
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:55,951
that he talked to me

988
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,386
about everything
that happened,

989
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:59,421
the way that he talked
about my father.

990
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:02,290
Your father was wrong.

991
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,392
Not about Visser.

992
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,660
There's no way
he was wrong,

993
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,061
because he
gave up everything.

994
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:10,232
He gave up his family
and his career and his life.

995
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,235
And you.

996
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:15,270
Yeah, and me.

997
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,774
I can't.

998
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:21,543
I can't watch you go
down the same hole.

999
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,445
We can't
do this right now.

1000
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:25,614
You gotta get
out of here, okay?

1001
01:01:25,616 --> 01:01:27,416
You have to go
right now.

1002
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:20,302
I asked you to teach me
how to get away with it,

1003
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:21,470
and you never did,

1004
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:22,938
because you couldn't,

1005
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,173
because you never did it.

1006
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,213
The watch trick,
it wasn't yours.

1007
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:32,714
Kemper used it.

1008
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:35,751
Right here,
there's a chapter

1009
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:38,320
on how to kill people
in your head,

1010
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:40,622
the aura phase, right?

1011
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:43,358
And then...
And then right here,

1012
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,926
underlined
and highlighted,

1013
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,528
the unguarded moment,

1014
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,663
it's exactly
what you said to me.

1015
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,766
What did you do?
You just learned everything

1016
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:51,768
from these books,

1017
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,802
and then you just
puked it out at me

1018
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:54,936
like it was yours?

1019
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,939
I told you who I was
that night in the woods.

1020
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:01,543
But you wanted me
to be this awful person,

1021
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:03,478
and I figured...

1022
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,648
who better?

1023
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:07,916
I've lived it.

1024
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:10,352
It's because they said
that it was you,

1025
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:11,586
and people believed it.

1026
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,622
I believed it.

1027
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,257
And then I believed you.

1028
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:18,927
No one has listened
to me for a long time.

1029
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:22,831
I'd almost make it true

1030
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,900
if you'd stay.

1031
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:30,572
I got a bad heart,
arthritis.

1032
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:32,140
Life's a gift from God,

1033
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:36,011
and I've wasted it,
no good works, no kids.

1034
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,447
There was a lady
I loved once back

1035
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,882
in Chicago, Sharon.

1036
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,854
I was gonna adopt
her son Franklin.

1037
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:48,723
Man, oh, man,
did that kid love me.

1038
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:52,994
They handcuffed me
right in front of them.

1039
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:57,265
I'll never forget
how scared they were,

1040
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:59,267
their faces.

1041
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,738
The man who arrested me
was so cruel.

1042
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,107
He didn't care
I had a family.

1043
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:08,510
He didn't care
a boy was gonna be

1044
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,644
without a dad.

1045
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:15,617
When they let me go,
I went to see her.

1046
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:19,054
She looked at me
like I was a monster.

1047
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,859
I never saw them again.

1048
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,830
What I did to you,

1049
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:31,233
lying all this time...

1050
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:35,270
there's no excuse.

1051
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,840
There's no excuse.

1052
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:41,676
But if you'd please
stay until after

1053
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,345
dinner tomorrow...

1054
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:48,250
you would surely
make an old man's

1055
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:49,252
Harvest Day.

1056
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,363
Yello.

1057
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:10,265
So you two playing
house over t here?

1058
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:13,835
Don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

1059
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:15,937
Hardaway came snooping
around yesterday

1060
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,839
wanting to know if I
talked to your boy.

1061
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:19,674
What do you want, Luis?
Well, my last check

1062
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:22,310
and pain and suffering for my
injuries. How 'bout that?

1063
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,147
Oh, okay.
Come on by the shop

1064
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,782
couple or three days,
and we'll...

1065
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:28,817
Ah, nah, nah, nah.

1066
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,652
Let's do this
now, Gene.

1067
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:41,463
I've gotta go
by the shop, see Luis.

1068
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:42,864
Eugene, I think...

1069
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:44,332
I won't be long.

1070
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:03,685
Yo, Eugene.

1071
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,293
Eugene.

1072
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,767
Fucking kidding me?

1073
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,711
What the... Hey, let go
of my fucking hand, man.

1074
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:33,114
Let go
of my fucking hand, Eugene.

1075
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,724
What's wrong with you, man?

1076
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:55,603
Kidding me, man?

1077
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,172
Give me the fucking check.

1078
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,083
Not bad.

1079
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,877
You still there, son?

1080
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:19,888
Shit.

1081
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,440
Yeah?
Hi.

1082
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:14,175
Hi.
Mr. Van Wingerdt?

1083
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:15,610
Mm-hmm.
Uh...

1084
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:17,512
we met yesterday.
You gave me a lift

1085
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:18,246
in your truck.

1086
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,547
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm...

1087
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,051
Look, I'm really,
really busy right now.

1088
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,386
Um, I know that I...

1089
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,789
I told you that I didn't
know anyone in town.

1090
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,257
Mm-hmm.

1091
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,426
Actually,
I'm here to see John.

1092
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:32,260
John?

1093
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:34,295
You guys know each other?

1094
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:35,330
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

1095
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,165
Well, I,
you know, knew him...

1096
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:39,300
heh... a couple times.

1097
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,337
And he told me
to meet him here.

1098
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:44,372
Here?
Yeah.

1099
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:46,107
I really need
to speak with him.

1100
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:47,109
It's important.

1101
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,676
Oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Sure.

1102
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:49,911
Come on in.

1103
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,049
So he's here?

1104
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:58,186
Yeah. He's here.

1105
01:10:58,188 --> 01:11:00,321
He's, uh...

1106
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:05,727
He's out back.

1107
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:24,046
Yeah.

1108
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,789
Hey, Visser.

1109
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,304
You didn't think this
was over, did you, John?

1110
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:25,173
You've known all along
who I was, right?

1111
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,375
That bit about you
being a serial killer,

1112
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:28,776
that was truly inspired.

1113
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,812
And that thing
with Kelli in the tub,

1114
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:33,448
you might just be better
at this than your old man.

1115
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,551
You may not believe me, son,

1116
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:39,053
but I never intended
for him to go and shove

1117
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:40,355
that gun in his mouth.

1118
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,590
Thomas stopped
answering my calls,

1119
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:45,259
tried to go on
living a normal life,

1120
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:47,462
whatever that is.
Stop talking about him.

1121
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:50,965
Girl came around looking
for you, pretty thing.

1122
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:53,468
I told her
not to panic, John.

1123
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:54,936
That's the key.

1124
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:57,772
She stays calm, well...

1125
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,040
you might find her.

1126
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,008
Where is she?

1127
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,844
You have all you need,

1128
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:04,912
one hour, maybe two.

1129
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:07,415
That seems fair.

1130
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:48,990
All right,
get the fuck up.

1131
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:50,324
Come on.
Ah, man,

1132
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:51,759
you have
officially fucked

1133
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:52,827
yourself for life.

1134
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:53,829
Give me your keys.

1135
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,096
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay, okay.

1136
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:56,618
Let's go.
Okay.

1137
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,169
Okay. Eugene is not
who you think he is.

1138
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:02,703
He's a serial killer
named Francis

1139
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:03,304
Allen Visser...

1140
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:04,306
Knock off
the story.

1141
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:06,073
He murders women.

1142
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:07,141
You know what?
Look at this,

1143
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:09,243
this photo,
that picture.

1144
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:10,278
He ever show you that?

1145
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,979
Look at that.

1146
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:13,181
He bought this photo.

1147
01:14:13,183 --> 01:14:14,549
He made it all up,

1148
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:16,451
and he's starting again.

1149
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:20,121
Chief, he takes those girls,
and he buries them alive.

1150
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:21,722
Is that what
you did to Kelli?

1151
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:23,891
Did you bury her alive?
No, I didn't bury her alive!

1152
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:26,928
I left Kelli in her car
up by Highway 2 with...

1153
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,299
When you're ready,

1154
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:33,301
drive out
of this shit town,

1155
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,470
and don't ever
come back, okay?

1156
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,372
Shit.

1157
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:40,074
Oh, God.

1158
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:42,944
No.

1159
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,752
Hello?

1160
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,161
Kid, get me
out of here!

1161
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,863
Audrey!

1162
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,933
Audrey!

1163
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,505
Hello!

1164
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,380
Gary, what are you
doing in there?

1165
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,382
Oh, Eugene.

1166
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:22,617
Thank God.
There we are.

1167
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:24,352
That kid you've
been hanging out with,

1168
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:25,887
he's gone off the rails.

1169
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:28,055
He's talking about
you burying people.

1170
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,316
Fuck!

1171
01:15:55,318 --> 01:15:56,318
Audrey!

1172
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,588
Hello!

1173
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,124
Oh, shit.
What do I do?

1174
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:04,792
Oh, fuck.

1175
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,829
Fuck.

1176
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:15,570
No.

1177
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:38,693
Can anybody hear me?!

1178
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,702
Somebody help me.

1179
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:50,438
Audrey?

1180
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,440
Hello?!

1181
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,208
Hello?!

1182
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,843
I'm down here!

1183
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:57,511
John.

1184
01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:59,246
John, I'm down here!

1185
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,649
I got you! I got you!

1186
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:05,820
Baby? Baby, you hear me?

1187
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:10,391
John!

1188
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,461
Get me out of here.

1189
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:14,962
Get me out of here.

1190
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,870
This must be
real exciting for you,

1191
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:24,905
following
in your daddy's footsteps.

1192
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:26,173
Fuck you.

1193
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,909
Shame the way that ended.

1194
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:32,279
Shit.
Gotta give him credit,

1195
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:33,381
real bulldog,

1196
01:17:33,383 --> 01:17:35,282
never let up.

1197
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:36,350
You know,
I've got Hardaway

1198
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:37,352
in the car right now.

1199
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:38,686
He's got
your fake family photos.

1200
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:40,087
He knows you're a liar.

1201
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,559
You think I'm going down
for a couple postcards?

1202
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:47,495
Some fairy tale?

1203
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:48,696
Hmm.

1204
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:50,097
What about
Luis and Kelli?

1205
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:51,465
Oh, Kelli.

1206
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:53,634
I had to follow
the two of you

1207
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:56,370
all the way out there
to finish that one off.

1208
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,072
And I gotta be honest.

1209
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:02,276
With a yummy ass
like that girl had,

1210
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,945
hoo, it was fun.

1211
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:06,647
You gotta know
you're not walking

1212
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:07,548
away from this.

1213
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,283
Son, look at me, son.

1214
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:10,951
I'm an old man.

1215
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:13,254
I've always walked away.

1216
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,425
Oh, God,

1217
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:20,828
a lifetime of walking away.
Fuck you.

1218
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:27,501
As long as there's
nothing linking me to Luis,

1219
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:29,904
I walk right out
of that police station

1220
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:31,772
just like I did
with your daddy.

1221
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:33,240
You, on the other hand,

1222
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:35,676
you really should
have been more careful.

1223
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:38,379
You are leaving
puzzle pieces

1224
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,047
everywhere you go.

1225
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,515
You've been
setting me up.

1226
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:42,616
Ho ho ho.

1227
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:45,519
And here you are,
the smoking gun.

1228
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:47,054
I gave John
an antique

1229
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:47,955
straight razor.

1230
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:50,591
Grace, the manager,
saw you leave

1231
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:51,625
with Kelli.

1232
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,065
Careful with what
you leave behind.

1233
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:02,570
You came here
to bring me to justice.

1234
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,505
I'm not gonna
soft-serve it for you.

1235
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:06,674
Heh. You failed.

1236
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:09,410
Just let... Just let...

1237
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:10,711
Let her go? Nah.

1238
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:12,880
I just don't think
it's in my nature.

1239
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,583
But don't worry.

1240
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:18,786
It'll be over soon.

1241
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:21,856
And then you'll feel
everything your daddy felt.

1242
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,330
Fuck you.

1243
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,276
John.

1244
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:50,651
Audrey. Audrey.

1245
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:51,986
Come here.

1246
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:57,725
Audrey, it's me.

1247
01:19:57,727 --> 01:19:59,393
You okay?

1248
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:01,195
I thought I was dead.

1249
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:03,364
I always wondered
what it'd be like

1250
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:05,966
to see somebody get out.

1251
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,104
Fuck you.

1252
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:12,139
Oh.

1253
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:22,149
Go get the Chief.

1254
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,717
Don't bother.

1255
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:25,753
He's had
an unfortunate

1256
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:26,755
incident.

1257
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,257
Maybe we can't pin
Luis on you,

1258
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:32,126
but Audrey right here

1259
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:33,961
is a walking,
talking piece of evidence

1260
01:20:33,963 --> 01:20:35,162
that didn't stay
in the box,

1261
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:38,465
and now we got
the Chief, too.

1262
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,801
And you know something?

1263
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:42,837
You lost, Eugene.

1264
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,405
Well, now,
that's a matter

1265
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:45,206
of opinion.

1266
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,006
Oh, really?

1267
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,008
Yeah.
Explain that to me.

1268
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,909
Girl stays
in the ground,

1269
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:51,312
another notch,
no big deal.

1270
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:53,547
But the day
I'm caught is the day

1271
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:57,785
everybody learns
the real scary truth.

1272
01:20:57,787 --> 01:21:00,154
It's the guy next door,

1273
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:02,656
guy who sits too close
in the theater,

1274
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:04,992
maybe even at church,

1275
01:21:04,994 --> 01:21:08,796
plain, ordinary,
the everyday man.

1276
01:21:08,798 --> 01:21:11,866
That's the guy they
should be afraid of,

1277
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:15,002
'cause they never
see him coming.

1278
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:18,072
It'll be quite a story.

1279
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:21,976
A son catches the killer
who beat his dad,

1280
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:26,881
and right at the center
of it all will be me,

1281
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:29,550
Frank Visser, me.

1282
01:21:32,588 --> 01:21:36,290
I never lose, son,
never, ever.

1283
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,496
What are you doing?

1284
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:45,699
I'm calling it in.

1285
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:48,502
Can't listen
to this shit anymore.

1286
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,474
Oh.

1287
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:55,609
Wait.

1288
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,285
What if we didn't?

1289
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,321
What do you mean?

1290
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,692
I mean what if
we don't call it in?

1291
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:13,627
We're cops.
What are you saying?

1292
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:14,695
That's what he wants.

1293
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:16,130
He wants us
to arrest him

1294
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:18,999
and connect him
to all those murders

1295
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,402
so he gets the fame
and the credit and

1296
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:22,269
all that shit,

1297
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,005
so the whole world
can see how fucking

1298
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:26,473
brilliant he is.

1299
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,376
But the only way
that doesn't happen...

1300
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,712
Is if we bury him.

1301
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:34,181
If we bury you...

1302
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,851
and everything
you've done.

1303
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:39,887
You couldn't do it.

1304
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:41,922
Oh, really?

1305
01:22:41,924 --> 01:22:43,891
You're right.
It won't be easy.

1306
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:45,759
It's all about adapting.

1307
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,595
It's what you've been doing
this whole time, right?

1308
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:49,997
Well, I'm adapting.

1309
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:52,666
It's just a matter
of being careful, being clean.

1310
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,668
Trust me.
We won't rush.

1311
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,303
Hardest part's
gonna be the Chief,

1312
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,138
making that look
like an accident,

1313
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,473
but we'll figure
something out.

1314
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,176
We're gonna make sure
the world never knows

1315
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:07,181
that Eugene Van Wingerdt was
once Francis Allen Visser.

1316
01:23:07,183 --> 01:23:09,416
You'll be the first one
the cops haul in.

1317
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:11,385
Oh, I'm sure.

1318
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:14,421
I'm sure they'll work me
for hours, days even.

1319
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:16,056
It doesn't matter.

1320
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,992
If they don't
have the evidence,

1321
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,460
they can't hold me.

1322
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:20,361
Isn't that right?

1323
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:23,063
Isn't that
what you taught me?

1324
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:26,533
You'll never
get away with it.

1325
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:29,403
Maybe, maybe not.

1326
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:31,538
But they'll never
find out about you.

1327
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,874
They'll never know
who you really were.

1328
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:35,909
Maybe I'll think about you

1329
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:37,745
on Thanksgiving
when I'm carving

1330
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:38,846
my turkey, maybe,

1331
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:40,848
or when I shave.

1332
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:42,449
But no one else.

1333
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:45,486
No one will ever
think of you, Eugene...

1334
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,822
never again.

1335
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:50,791
You'll be forgotten,

1336
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:53,527
like it never
fucking happened.

1337
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,735
That's pretty good,
isn't it?

1338
01:24:01,737 --> 01:24:03,937
Hey, I had
a good teacher.

1339
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:05,639
You know, I got
something else, though,

1340
01:24:05,641 --> 01:24:06,573
that you never had,

1341
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:08,609
an alibi.

1342
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:10,844
Right, baby?

1343
01:24:10,846 --> 01:24:12,079
What do you think?

1344
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:15,682
I can't do it on my own.

1345
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:17,217
You with me?

1346
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:24,191
We better get started.

1347
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:28,429
No. No!

1348
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:29,797
No! No!

1349
01:24:29,799 --> 01:24:31,331
You have all you need...
No!

1350
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:33,700
One hour, maybe two.
No, please!

1351
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:35,569
That seems fair.
No! No!

1352
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,853
John, are you okay?
