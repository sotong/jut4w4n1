<i>Previously on Reign:</i>

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,595
Mother.

10
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:34,697
- You're...
- Marie de Guise.

11
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:36,098
Your future mother-in-law.

12

<i>CATHERINE: It's a nuptial contract.</i>

13
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,269
- He confessed to your night in Paris.
- Oh, no.

14
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:43,137
Wouldn't it be best if we
just told Francis the truth?

15
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:45,139
No! For me, it would not.

16
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:46,741
Marry Lord Julien.

17
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:48,576
He came to France looking
to make a good marriage.

18
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:50,779
He could give your child a name.

19
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:53,047
- You promised me someone with a title.
- Fine.

20
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:56,284
Bash, I hereby declare you
the Master of Horse and Hunt.

21
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,919
What does that even mean?

22
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:59,420
HENRY: Shut up and say the words.

23
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:00,521
KENNA (crying): Please! This is marriage.

24
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:01,622
It can't be undone!

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,580
Say the words!

26
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:11,554
(impatiently sighs, metal clinks)

27
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,426
Your shaving mirror is useless.

28
00:01:13,494 --> 00:01:17,263
We'll have your dressing
table and mirror brought in.

29
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:18,931
And where would they go?

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,266
I don't understand

31
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:21,934
why I couldn't stay in my old chambers.

32
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:23,970
- Because you're married.
- Yes, I know.

33
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:26,373
The king's bastard, no less,
when I asked for a man of title.

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,040
(inhales) The king gave me one.

35
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:30,109
(scoffs) The "Master of Horse and Hunt"?

36
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:32,478
That's something Henry made up.

37
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,714
It comes with no wealth, no land.

38
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:37,383
The title I was expecting
was the Duke of Anjou,

39
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,618
with a château in Anjou,

40
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:40,119
with a suite of rooms in Anjou.

41
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,522
You act as though this were my fault.

42
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,356
I'm no happier about it than you.

43
00:01:44,424 --> 00:01:46,025
You? What do you have to complain about?

44
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:47,726
You're now married to a
beautiful woman of noble birth.

45
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:49,628
Who's notorious for
sleeping with my father.

46
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:50,996
I see no awkwardness there.

47
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:53,732
Yes, well... it's all in the past.

48
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,733
Is it?

49
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,402
We both know Henry.

50
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,337
We know he enjoys the
privileges of kingship.

51
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,972
As you enjoy the privileges of...

52
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,408
whatever it is a relationship
with my father can get you.

53
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:04,976
You make it sound as though

54
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:06,177
I'm the most self-centered
woman in France.

55
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,546
Oh, I can't say that.

56
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,212
I haven't met all the women in France.

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,548
Fine.

58
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:11,716
Then all I care about is me.

59
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,685
And all you care about is Mary.

60
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,355
I'm not jealous, truly.

61
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:19,250
But a love like that,

62
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:21,652
could destroy both of our lives.

63
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,422
She's married.

64
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:25,923
It's in the past.

65
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:30,369
(sighs) All right, yes, I see your point.

66
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:33,138
(sighs) We both need to
keep our pasts in the past.

67
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,473
This is our life now, Kenna.

68
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:37,142
It's not what we chose,

69
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:41,714
but we're married before
king and God, till death.

70
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:44,416
I won't pretend I love you, but...

71
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,187
we should probably start
liking each other at least.

72
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,488
From the Sultan in Constantinople.

73
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:52,090
How long will they keep coming?

74
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:53,425
Oh, my mother said gifts for her wedding

75
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,393
- were drifting in for a good year.
- (Groans)

76
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:56,994
A bridle?

77
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,496
SECRETARY: For the Arabian thoroughbred

78
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,831
now in your stables, Your Grace.

79
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:01,333
Ah.

80
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,500
Better try it on your wife.

81
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,902
It may help you to keep her in hand.

82
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:07,205
(laughter)

83
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,808
Music.

84
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:11,843
Care for a dance?

85
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,878
Mm.

86
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:15,479
Thank you for understanding.

87
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:18,382
Does the court truly not notice
the change in your father?

88
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,351
Any who do are keeping their mouths shut.

89
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:24,321
And the rest attribute my
father's behavior to his temper.

90
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,391
France cannot be governed by a mad king.

91
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,194
He's ill, Mary.

92
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,397
They can find no trace of poison,

93
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,532
perhaps something is wrong.

94
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:38,402
He needs our compassion. Time to recover.

95
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,303
And what if he doesn't recover?

96
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:44,440
My mother's doing her best
to divert important matters

97
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,442
from the king to her;

98
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,879
trying to run the country
behind my father's back;

99
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:51,782
keeping the world from
seeing how sick he is.

100
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,850
These days he seems infatuated by Penelope.

101
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:56,352
He barely even notices affairs of state.

102
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,688
She may be a blessing in disguise.

103
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,757
(Penelope whispering)

104
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,927
(laughter, indistinct
conversations, music playing)

105
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,128
How's Lord Julien?

106
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,598
He's charming.

107
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,933
We've been riding, walking in the hills...

108
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,269
he taught me to skate.

109
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,403
He makes me laugh.

110
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,172
And?

111
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:17,506
For a man we know is looking for a wife,

112
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,675
he's been slow off the mark.

113
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,178
I'm going to be showing any day now.

114
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:24,413
What if he's not the right man?

115
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,748
Maybe I don't really please him.

116
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,583
Or maybe he just needs a push.

117
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,588
Oh, he'll get a push.

118
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,494
Lady Lola.

119
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,463
You're a vision of grace.

120
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,264
Thank you.

121
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,266
Such a lovely night, isn't it?

122
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,702
Such beautiful music.

123
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,539
Would you honor me with a dance?

124
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:53,074
I thought you'd never ask.

125
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,346
You're unusually clear on what
you desire from others, Lady Lola.

126
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:02,683
(dance music playing)

127
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:05,118
I'm not complaining.

128
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:06,554
We're well matched.

129
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:09,189
We could be two annoyingly
direct people together.

130
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,224
(laughs)

131
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:12,827
So I'll say, directly,

132
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:15,830
that I'm in a mood for marrying.

133
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:18,232
But I fear I'm not the
husband most women would want.

134
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,567
That's nonsense.

135
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:23,337
You're titled, wealthy and good company.

136
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:26,206
And you were patient when
you taught me to skate.

137
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,641
Is patience important when it
comes to choosing a partner?

138
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:31,178
We live in a world
where marriage is a risk;

139
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:34,081
where a husband may become a tyrant.

140
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,916
I think most women would count
themselves lucky to be yours.

141
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,353
Women run more risks than that, Lola.

142
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,492
I was married twice before.

143
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:48,327
Both my wives died in childbirth.

144
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,096
They died in blood and pain.

145
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,098
Far too young.

146
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:55,167
I won't go through that again.

147
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,003
That's why I've decided
never to have children.

148
00:05:58,105 --> 00:05:59,505
What?!

149
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,375
I can't lose anyone
else that way. I refuse.

150
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,675
I don't need heirs;

151
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,444
my line would continue, I have brothers.

152
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,846
But, i... i... if you want to marry...

153
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,115
There are ways to prevent conception.

154
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,751
That thought needn't upset you.

155
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,019
We'd be happy.

156
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,755
I, uh, I... I suppose.

157
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,023
That's grand.

158
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:21,192
Would you consider doing me the honor

159
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,694
of becoming my wife?

160
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,230
(nervously exhales)

161
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:26,131
Say, "Yes."

162
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:28,033
Please.

163
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,968
Uh... yes.

164
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:31,136
(sighs in relief)

165
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:37,708
I have an announcement to make.

166
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:40,678
The beautiful creature
standing beside me...

167
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:42,880
has agreed to be my wife.

168
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:45,416
(laughter, applause)

169
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,688
Oh...

170
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,323
(gasps) Oh!

171
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:53,390
Oh! I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.

172
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,459
It's all right.

173
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:55,960
Wait a moment, then follow me out.

174
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,062
There's something you should know.

175
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:02,132
Why should I believe a word that you say?

176
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,001
I know you're one of
Catherine's ladies-in-waiting.

177
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,469
I am one of Catherine's ladies.

178
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,503
One of her special ladies.

179
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:07,771
They call us the "Flying Squad."

180
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,673
We're trained and polished

181
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,641
and sent to sleep with important noblemen

182
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,410
and report back to her.

183
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,445
Haven't you ever wondered
why she knows so very much?

184
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:17,013
It can't all be from servant gossip.

185
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:18,582
Well, I'm sure you're well rewarded

186
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:20,450
for making love to men
and then betraying them.

187
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,018
We are.

188
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,420
This time, the queen has overstepped.

189
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:26,155
She asked me to seduce the king,

190
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:28,358
to remove him from Penelope's influence

191
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,659
and see that he was engaged with someone

192
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:31,361
that Catherine could control.

193
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,963
I'm sure that would be
quite a notch on your belt.

194
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,365
The most powerful man in France.

195
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,533
He's the most dangerous man in France.

196
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:39,369
The queen briefed me.

197
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:40,803
Too well.

198
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,305
A mad king?

199
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,773
I'm not going near him.

200
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:46,876
So you told Catherine "No"?

201
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,844
The queen does not react well to refusal.

202
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:49,845
Hmm.

203
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:51,113
I must leave France.

204
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,114
Quickly.

205
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:53,516
You could arrange it.

206
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,150
You could find me sanctuary in Scotland.

207
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,185
In exchange for what?

208
00:07:57,253 --> 00:08:01,724
I have information that is vital
to your safety and Scotland's.

209
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,294
Where's Francis?

210
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,497
- I really need him.
- He's gone to the stables

211
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:09,797
to see the new thoroughbred.

212
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,566
I think half the men went with him.

213
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,237
Well, this will be awkward.

214
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,939
(indistinct conversations, laughter)

215
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,911
(whispered conversation)

216
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,113
(Bash sighs)

217
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:35,489
CHARLOTTE: Hurry.

218
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,726
Not so fast. I pay my debts.

219
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:42,863
Your Grace, when you signed
your marriage contracts,

220
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,731
you didn't know that
there was a secret clause

221
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,167
slipped in among them.

222
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,035
It promises that if
you die without an heir,

223
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,337
Scotland will belong to France.

224
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,706
How do you know this?

225
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,875
I was ordered to sleep with the bishop,

226
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,578
see if he was open to
amending the contracts.

227
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,913
Drive!

228
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,782
CHARLOTTE: Be careful, Your Grace.

229
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,050
Without an heir, you're worth more to them

230
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,517
dead than alive.

231
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:13,651
A "secret clause"?

232
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,519
This is exactly the sort of trick

233
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,155
my family would pull.

234
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,758
Well, the contracts went
on forever, page after page.

235
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,092
Some were even in Latin. Well,
I'm sure it was well hidden.

236
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,362
I'm going to go to my mother
and demand to know if it's true

237
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,130
and what the hell she and my
father think they're doing.

238
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,765
They think they're getting insurance.

239
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,133
In case I'm not cooperative

240
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,768
in laying claim to the throne of England.

241
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,270
If I don't provide an heir...

242
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,104
Then there's a sword hanging over you.

243
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,741
If you're not named the
English queen's successor,

244
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:39,476
my father can cut his losses, kill you

245
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:42,345
and gain Scotland to use as his
staging area to invade England.

246
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,683
If he can't use me to get
England while I'm alive...

247
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:50,154
he'll use me dead.

248
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,789
Francis, don't tell your mother just yet.

249
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,157
I don't want her to know that we know.

250
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:56,192
We must find out if Charlotte
was telling the truth

251
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,663
or if she just concocted a story
to get herself out of France.

252
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,631
We need to get that contract.

253
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:04,200
It's the only way to confirm
what Charlotte said is true.

254
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,068
Where does the king keep
his important papers?

255
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:07,437
In his chambers, mostly.

256
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:08,738
The guards are unlikely

257
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,406
to let you or me in without a good reason.

258
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,610
There's one person I know
that they will let in.

259
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:18,981
There's a special paper
I need to find and...

260
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:21,517
it's in Henry's chambers.

261
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:24,486
Mary, the king's lost his mind!

262
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:27,356
I'd be taking my own life into my hands.

263
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,857
Also, I'm a married
woman and I promised Bash.

264
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:30,492
I understand.

265
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,227
And if you can't do it, I won't press you.

266
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:35,397
But you should know what
I need you to look for.

267
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:38,834
Henry and Catherine... (sighs)

268
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:40,502
have betrayed the alliance.

269
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,838
They deceived me into signing a contract

270
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:44,672
that gives our Scotland to the French.

271
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,842
If I die without an heir,

272
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,444
Scotland will lose her freedom.

273
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,046
That cannot happen.

274
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,315
We must do something.

275
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:00,855
GUARD: The king is not in
his chambers, Lady Kenna.

276
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:02,623
He asked me to wait for him.

277
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,760
"Paragraph two."

278
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:41,795
"In case of wife's death... "

279
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:44,264
GUARD: My lord!

280
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,075
Kenna.

281
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,610
(door closes)

282
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:01,080
I know why you're here.

283
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:03,116
You do?

284
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,218
Mm-hmm.

285
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:08,120
You miss me.

286
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,292
It's a copy.

287
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:14,359
Without my signature.

288
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:15,628
Who knows where the original is.

289
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:18,130
I'm sorry, Mary.

290
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,231
You've been betrayed.

291
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:21,767
This is nothing more

292
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:23,468
than a license to murder
whenever it's convenient.

293
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:24,937
It's not just a threat to me.

294
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,939
It's a threat to my country.

295
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:28,941
This alliance was supposed to strengthen us

296
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:32,110
against England, not sell us out.

297
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,979
I'll write to my mother.

298
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:35,680
- When she hears of this...
- Mary, it's not just my family

299
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,282
that's betrayed you.

300
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,817
Your mother's advisor spent hours

301
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,217
going over the contracts.

302
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,656
I've just looked through
the ledgers of the Treasury.

303
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,659
On the day of our marriage,
a surprisingly large payment

304
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,126
was made to Marie de Guise

305
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,062
for services rendered the crown.

306
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,468
She was desperate for
money to prop up her rule,

307
00:12:57,535 --> 00:13:00,338
and I'm sure she thought that
this was an easy way to get it.

308
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:02,840
That you would conceive an
heir, live a long and happy life,

309
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,275
and never even know about it.

310
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:08,145
We will have a son, Mary, in time.

311
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:11,515
I know.

312
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,017
We can't hand this off to someone else.

313
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,186
All of our parents are in on it.

314
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,688
I know.

315
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,189
They won't lift a finger to change things.

316
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,258
Unless they're forced.

317
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:25,362
My mother is under immense pressure

318
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,430
from the Protestant faction in Scotland.

319
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:28,865
They would love to oust her

320
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,700
and see the nation under Protestant rule.

321
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,236
What if they found out

322
00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:35,372
that she had sold out
her country for money?

323
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,374
Her political enemies.

324
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,209
Don't you think that they
would use that against her?

325
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:41,744
They'd whip up Scotland into a frenzy.

326
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,414
To save her rule, she'll have to deny it.

327
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,782
Say she'd never think
of doing such a thing.

328
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,184
Publicly distance herself
from ever trying it.

329
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,120
She would have to find
her copy of the contract.

330
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,889
And burn it.

331
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,757
And when France sees Scotland
baying for French blood...

332
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,559
It'll be the same.

333
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,427
My father is obsessed with England.

334
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,195
He doesn't want to waste
the lives of his troops

335
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:02,264
on a pointless war with Scotland.

336
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:05,200
- And my mother...
- No, she knows this is no time for a war.

337
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:07,702
Not with a mad king leading the army.

338
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:09,771
Francis, if this works, your parents

339
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,373
will have to burn the evidence.

340
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,108
It'll be as if the contract never existed.

341
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,776
Once the news is in Scotland,

342
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,645
we can trust your mother's
enemies to do the rest.

343
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,748
But are you sure you want
to do it this way, Mary?

344
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:22,150
You are setting your mother
up for a very hard time.

345
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:24,252
Then she shouldn't have deceived me.

346
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:27,822
My first duty is not to my mother.

347
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:29,157
I am the Queen of Scotland,

348
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:30,825
not the Queen of Marie de Guise.

349
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,895
Well, the hard part of
the plan will be getting

350
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,129
the word out of France.

351
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:36,564
My mother will be suspicious

352
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,999
of any letters addressed
to Scottish Protestants.

353
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,637
I think the next step...

354
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,173
is to have a party.

355
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,682
(festive music playing,
indistinct chatter, laughing)

356
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,851
(shouting happily)

357
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,720
(laughter)

358
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:58,555
Did you have to invite quite so many...

359
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,391
Scots?

360
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:02,926
Diplomacy.

361
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,428
I want my countrymen to know

362
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:06,096
that France doesn't
have all of my attention.

363
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:07,131
Hmm.

364
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:09,600
I don't suppose you have

365
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,701
seen my Lady Charlotte around, have you?

366
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:13,069
She seems to have disappeared.

367
00:15:13,104 --> 00:15:15,071
- Oh.
- Oh.

368
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,873
Because someone said

369
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,275
they saw her speaking with you.

370
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,977
Ah.

371
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:24,080
My ladies can be quite
temperamental sometimes.

372
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:26,449
They're like disgruntled servants

373
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,785
who get turned out for
breaking the crockery.

374
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:31,086
They blame their mistress.

375
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:33,822
And carry lying tales.

376
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:35,791
She only said she was sorry

377
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,793
for spilling her drink on me.

378
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,895
But I will bear your warning in mind

379
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,564
if I ever have a conversation with her.

380
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,032
Oh.

381
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:47,569
If she finds out, if she's even suspicious,

382
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:49,872
she could do anything.

383
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,740
She's just irritated that we've invited

384
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,742
every Scot within a hundred
miles of French court.

385
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,411
All to hide our interest in just one.

386
00:15:56,445 --> 00:16:00,615
Lord McKenzie is concluding a
deal with the French military

387
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,117
to provide wool for their uniforms.

388
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:05,253
He's expected to go home any day now.

389
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,755
FRANCIS: Anyone we trust

390
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:09,257
to make the news public in Scotland

391
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:10,958
could go straight to Marie de Guise instead

392
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:12,294
and demand payment for their silence.

393
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:15,197
Years ago, he fought with my
father against the English.

394
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,565
He is a loyal man.

395
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,566
FRANCIS: Years ago,

396
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,133
he was a loyal man.

397
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,634
He has spent the time since then

398
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:22,369
becoming a wealthy, comfortable man.

399
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:24,538
Will he want to anger
the French government?

400
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:26,708
Risk losing his business deal?

401
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:29,643
I suppose we'll find out.

402
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,445
(men cheering)

403
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:42,723
Henry is adding diamonds to my crown

404
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,459
to sparkle as I do, he says.

405
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,994
Don't you think a royal crown suits me?

406
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,963
Of course, Your Majesty.

407
00:16:49,997 --> 00:16:51,699
It makes your head look smaller.

408
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:54,101
Almost back to normal size.

409
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,238
You're a saucy one, aren't you?

410
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,540
I beg your pardon?

411
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:01,708
(laughs) Saucy?

412
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:02,909
Don't be offended.

413
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:04,310
It's a good word, "saucy."

414
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:08,648
It's sauce that makes food worth eating.

415
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:11,384
And women like you that
make life worth living.

416
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,653
You're outrageous.

417
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:16,188
Oh, don't take yourself
away from me, beauty.

418
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:17,323
Do you know who I am?

419
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:18,424
I can guess.

420
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:20,360
From the clues I'd say, uh,

421
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:21,761
you're a lady-in-waiting.

422
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:24,397
You're too well-dressed
to be anything else.

423
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:26,531
And by the fleur-de-lis
on your bracelet,

424
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,833
you serve the Queen of France.

425
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:30,369
And by the tone of your conversation

426
00:17:30,403 --> 00:17:32,004
with the queen,

427
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:33,839
I'd say you're out of favor.

428
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,209
You're right.

429
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:40,112
I do serve the Queen of France.

430
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:42,347
(gasps)

431
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:47,118
Well, if it isn't the master of...

432
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,921
two amusing things.

433
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:51,356
How's marriage treating you?

434
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,258
As well as can be expected.

435
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:54,259
(chuckles)

436
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:55,694
(gasps)

437
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,596
Have you seen Lady Eugenie tonight?

438
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,898
Will her charming bosom
fall out of that gown?

439
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:01,032
What do you think?

440
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,901
I think I'm married.

441
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,702
No reason to let that slow you down.

442
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,405
The Lady Kenna could teach
you something about that.

443
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:09,207
Probably a few other things, too.

444
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,375
Oh?

445
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,944
Her wedding barely past,

446
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:14,045
and there she was, her rump

447
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,546
like a ripe apple in my hand.

448
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,714
I'd forgotten how she looks from behind,

449
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,482
perky as a young deer.

450
00:18:18,517 --> 00:18:21,051
You know how when you see
the white tail of a hind,

451
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,421
and you long to bury your arrow in...

452
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:26,056
Am I to understand you called
Lady Kenna to your chambers?

453
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,758
I gave no summons. She was waiting for me.

454
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,226
You can't blame the girl.

455
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,730
Think.

456
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:36,366
You could have a king's
son as your firstborn.

457
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:42,806
My gift to you.

458
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:52,349
Your queen wishes to have a word with you.

459
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,154
Just you.

460
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,256
My men like to stay close.

461
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:01,858
The queen wants privacy.

462
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,393
Oh, it'll be private.

463
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:05,527
They'll be just outside the door.

464
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:13,870
Mary, I don't like this.

465
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:15,271
Well, you're right. We don't know

466
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:16,973
if we can trust Lord McKenzie.

467
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,441
- Or anyone.
- I know, but...

468
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,209
Change of plan.

469
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,944
Lord McKenzie...

470
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:24,546
why do your men stay outside?

471
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,947
They can hear what I have to say.

472
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:39,794
Well, lass...

473
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,363
why am I here?

474
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,299
You fought with my father at Solway Moss.

475
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,301
What was it like?

476
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:49,804
It was hell on Earth.

477
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,973
I listened to the screams of men impaled

478
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,208
with arrows as they died on that marsh.

479
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,310
And at day's end,

480
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:59,814
your father limped home and died.

481
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:02,049
And did your heart die with him?

482
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,686
For the past ten years,

483
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:07,254
you have lived here,
in the safety of France,

484
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,056
and I've seen too much suffering at home.

485
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,590
And you would ask of my heart?

486
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:12,226
Ask me that question

487
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,428
when you have earned the right.

488
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:22,369
The day of my marriage,

489
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:25,406
a secret contract was
slipped in amongst the others.

490
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:27,707
The French arranged it with my mother.

491
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:30,376
It gives Scotland to France,

492
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:32,245
if I die without an heir.

493
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:34,213
I cannot allow it to stand.

494
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:35,515
Do you understand what I'm saying?

495
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,850
I cannot allow it.

496
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:38,752
I may live in France,

497
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:41,387
but I have the heart of a Scot.

498
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,289
France has betrayed us!

499
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:45,524
So I charge you men

500
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,727
to take the news with you.

501
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:50,796
Tell the world.

502
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:54,200
But most especially, tell Lord Hardie,

503
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:57,536
the leader of the Protestants
who oppose my mother.

504
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:59,538
They will raise such a stink,

505
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:01,540
the contract will never survive.

506
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,408
You'd defy Marie de Guise?

507
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,544
I would defy the Devil himself if he tried

508
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,145
to buy and sell my country!

509
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,750
I will not risk Scotland's freedom.

510
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:16,288
So...

511
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:19,391
like my father, I ask you
to give up your comfort.

512
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:21,659
To do what is right.

513
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:23,661
You will lose your business deal.

514
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:27,065
You will earn the anger of my mother.

515
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,568
And I have nothing to give you

516
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,537
in exchange, except my gratitude.

517
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:52,423
Your Majesty.

518
00:21:55,894 --> 00:22:01,265
We have waited a long,
long time for you to rise.

519
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:14,989
That was amazing. I never...

520
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:16,725
In France, the queen is the person

521
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,226
who is married to the king.

522
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,928
But to those men, you are their liege lord,

523
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,231
the one to whom oaths of loyalty are made.

524
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,632
No one's ever looked
at me like that before.

525
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,303
I can still feel it,
like a weight in my chest.

526
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:31,405
All my life, I have been a chess piece

527
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:32,706
in other people's courts.

528
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:34,475
But now I have the responsibility.

529
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,844
Mary, your people have been
ruled by a regent for too long.

530
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:38,712
They are ready to give their hearts to you,

531
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,981
the true queen.

532
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:41,749
There is power there,

533
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:43,517
if you can take it and keep it.

534
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:50,223
LIAM: Like a bit of privacy, do you?

535
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,359
- Afraid for your reputation?
- You could say that.

536
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:54,695
So you've never been

537
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:56,497
to French court before.

538
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,098
My first night and my last.

539
00:22:58,165 --> 00:22:59,599
Mmm...

540
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,834
I return to Paris tomorrow,
with Lord McKenzie,

541
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,070
to conclude our business, and then..

542
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:05,338
Back home to Scotland.

543
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:07,340
Really?

544
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,075
Have you ever been to Scotland?

545
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,245
My duty doesn't allow me
to travel beyond France.

546
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,347
Oh, yes, the queen.

547
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:16,449
You can't leave her.

548
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:18,951
Tedious though her company may be,

549
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:21,186
I'll never really escape her.

550
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,222
Mmm.

551
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,858
Tell me about Scotland.

552
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:30,730
Well, cold and harsh, some call her.

553
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:33,933
But with beauty

554
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,700
that can pierce your heart.

555
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:42,674
(moans)

556
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:47,012
(door opens)

557
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:51,149
- The king's chambers?
- Excuse me?

558
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:52,417
Do you deny you were there?

559
00:23:55,588 --> 00:23:57,722
We didn't...

560
00:23:57,757 --> 00:23:59,290
actually have sex.

561
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:00,592
I don't want to calibrate

562
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:01,827
the exact inch you stopped.

563
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:03,261
We had an agreement.

564
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:04,628
I remember.

565
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:06,130
I also remember you jumping very high

566
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:07,665
to answer Mary's beck and call.

567
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:10,734
So your visiting my father

568
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,503
is a form of childish payback?

569
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,505
Or payment for... what?

570
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:16,774
You think I went to the
king's chambers for fun?

571
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:18,343
He's lost his mind.

572
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:20,144
I was terrified the
whole time I was with him.

573
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:21,278
Why did you go to him, then?

574
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:22,813
For Mary. My queen.

575
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:24,482
She asked me to find

576
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:26,817
a secret document that
put my country at risk.

577
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,152
- Mary sent you into the lion's den?
- She asked,

578
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,220
and I agreed.

579
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:31,522
I know you don't think

580
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,823
I notice anything that's not

581
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,191
a pretty dress or a jewel,

582
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:35,192
but strangely enough,

583
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,460
I give a damn about my country.

584
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:39,329
Henry came in just as I found the paper,

585
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:40,830
and there was nothing I could do.

586
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,300
I couldn't tell him why I was really there.

587
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:47,704
His very touch makes me ill.

588
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:49,672
I'm sorry.

589
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:51,875
My country was at stake,

590
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,410
but what was at stake for you

591
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:55,177
when Mary batted her
eyes and you rushed off

592
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,646
to be her true and gentle knight?

593
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:59,482
You'll never be that knight for me.

594
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,419
You'll be my husband, but never that.

595
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,186
Stop.

596
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:07,290
KENNA: This marriage is based on nothing.

597
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,361
What a pair my father tied
together for a lifetime.

598
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,533
(bell tolling)

599
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,834
(door opens)

600
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:22,138
I love getting a mysterious summons

601
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,872
from my bride-to-be.

602
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,707
Julien, thank you for coming.

603
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,810
There's something I have to tell you.

604
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,046
Is it about the wedding?

605
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,716
Y... your... family?

606
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:38,019
- Have you changed your mi... ?
- I'm pregnant.

607
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,660
(sighs)

608
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,265
That's why Mary pushed me
towards you so aggressively.

609
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:54,269
Why you said yes so quickly.

610
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:57,138
I know this all happened so fast, but...

611
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:58,573
do you care for me at all?

612
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,140
If I didn't care for you,

613
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,809
why would I be confessing to you now?

614
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:04,579
Will you tell me who the father is?

615
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,582
No.

616
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:08,816
I don't want him to know.

617
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,918
Why?

618
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,289
So...

619
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:16,790
you've been carrying this secret

620
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,525
around with you.

621
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:19,793
Alone.

622
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,762
Oh, Lola.

623
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:24,865
(sighs)

624
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,302
We've both made such a botch of our lives.

625
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,536
How have you made a botch... ?

626
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,971
Shh.

627
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,839
I won't ask about your past,

628
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,374
if you don't ask about mine.

629
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:42,616
Well...

630
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,018
I suppose we'd better have the wedding

631
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:48,154
before you start to show.

632
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:49,822
You still want to marry me?

633
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:52,125
Are you still the most
beautiful girl I know?

634
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,792
Yes.

635
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:55,495
Are you still the most annoyingly direct?

636
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:56,729
Yes.

637
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,259
I don't need a match made in Heaven.

638
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:02,195
I'll be perfectly happy with a match

639
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,397
made somewhere north of Paris.

640
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:06,498
(both laugh)

641
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:11,369
LIAM: You are magnificent and daring.

642
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:13,706
But don't you think we're
pushing our luck by lingering?

643
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,240
If the queen were to discover us

644
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:16,942
here, in her chambers,

645
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:18,811
I doubt nothing short of our
executions would satisfy her.

646
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,345
Wherever the queen is,

647
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:23,415
I assure you she's already quite satisfied.

648
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,324
What are you doing?

649
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,962
Nothing reveals an indiscretion

650
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:40,531
quite like hair gone wild.

651
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,834
You know where everything is.

652
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:45,369
Mmm.

653
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:48,773
And that robe you just picked up

654
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,008
fits you perfectly.

655
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,475
Oh, it should.

656
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,078
Because you're the queen.

657
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,081
How perceptive of you.

658
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:02,353
I suppose bowing would be pointless now.

659
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:05,256
Well, you've shown your
willingness to serve me

660
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,759
quite sufficiently this past hour.

661
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:10,727
But...

662
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:13,764
you'd be advised, for your own safety,

663
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:15,465
to keep this to yourself.

664
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:17,333
Not that anyone would believe you.

665
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:18,468
Why didn't you tell me?

666
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:19,870
If you'd known I was a queen,

667
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:21,638
would you have gone through with it?

668
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:25,042
I would have gone through
with it no matter who you are.

669
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,710
I made love to you because

670
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:30,780
you are the most intriguing
woman I've met in France.

671
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:33,283
Oh, Lord McKenzie thought he was so special

672
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,318
for having a private
session with Queen Mary.

673
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:37,520
With Mary?

674
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:39,455
A private session?

675
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,790
Aye.

676
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,227
Now he says we're not going to Paris,

677
00:28:44,295 --> 00:28:45,394
but straight back to Scotland

678
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:46,862
in the morning, on the first ship.

679
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,798
What, your business unfinished?

680
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:50,465
How odd.

681
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:54,804
I wonder what he and Mary spoke about.

682
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:56,505
No idea, but he was feeling

683
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:57,807
quite singled out about it,

684
00:28:57,874 --> 00:29:00,409
it seemed, by the expression on his face.

685
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:01,810
Favored by the queen.

686
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:03,645
If only he knew about this.

687
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,515
Of course, he won't.

688
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:07,849
Don't worry.

689
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:31,439
Mary knows.

690
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,367
(men laughing) Liam.

691
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:36,635
Where have you been, friend?

692
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:38,570
The men and I are going into the village

693
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:40,572
for a final night of hospitality,

694
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:42,107
courtesy of, uh...

695
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:45,377
some of France's most experienced ladies.

696
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:46,878
You'll join us?

697
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:48,747
I think I won't.

698
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:50,381
Ah, a whore is such a disappointment

699
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,750
after you've had the real thing.

700
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:54,419
But you poor fellows go, enjoy yourselves.

701
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,420
Very well.

702
00:29:55,455 --> 00:29:56,655
We sail in the morning.

703
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:02,694
(horses gallop away)

704
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,072
(choking)

705
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:22,746
(laughter, indistinct conversations)

706
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:30,888
Hey, hey...

707
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:32,957
why do you keep looking at that door?

708
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:36,026
The only thing you need
to worry about opening

709
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,794
- is my britches.
- (Giggles)

710
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,104
MAN: Little lassie! Lassie, come here.

711
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,147
(pounding on door)

712
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,783
Agh! No!

713
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:08,457
(wind whistling)

714
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,494
What the devil is going on?

715
00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:14,430
Aah!

716
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:15,597
(groaning)

717
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,167
(men shouting)

718
00:31:18,235 --> 00:31:19,468
(woman screams)

719
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:23,005
(woman screams, man grunts)

720
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:24,706
(grunts)

721
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:26,008
(screaming)

722
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:28,143
(yells)

723
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:09,316
(knocking at door)

724
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,286
It's done.

725
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:14,655
Every man?

726
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,257
Every man of Lord McKenzie's?

727
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:18,625
Yes.

728
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:21,462
And the whores?

729
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,896
The ones we paid off got away.

730
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,198
They won't be coming back.

731
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:26,433
The few we were worried would talk...

732
00:32:26,468 --> 00:32:27,867
they died with the men.

733
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:30,370
My lady...

734
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:32,639
they were whoring themselves
to the Scots when we came in.

735
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,074
It's not as if they were innocents.

736
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:36,476
(wry laugh) No.

737
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,277
I'm sure they chose
their vocation willingly,

738
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:39,913
happy to service men like you.

739
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,547
My lady... ?!

740
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:42,548
Go away.

741
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:50,556
(sighs)

742
00:32:50,591 --> 00:32:53,559
(distant bell tolling)

743
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:55,661
(knocking on door)

744
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:02,301
My condolences on...

745
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:05,771
(shouts, groans)

746
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,572
the loss of your countrymen.

747
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:09,908
As I see, you've already heard.

748
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,817
This was not lightly done.

749
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:20,519
It's a matter of royal business.

750
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:24,489
France cannot afford a war
with Scotland over the contract.

751
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:25,757
And with the king ill,

752
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,025
I simply don't have time

753
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,761
to try to calm down two countries.

754
00:33:29,828 --> 00:33:32,930
You killed a dozen men

755
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:37,569
because you couldn't be
bothered with the extra trouble?

756
00:33:39,672 --> 00:33:41,572
I will never forgive you for this.

757
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,975
Forgive me or forgive yourself?

758
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:46,610
Welcome to being a ruling queen, Mary.

759
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:49,020
Men will trust you and die.

760
00:33:49,054 --> 00:33:50,554
These are the first.

761
00:33:50,588 --> 00:33:53,724
But they won't be the last.

762
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:55,426
It'll go on and on, until your death,

763
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,260
because that's the way it works.

764
00:33:57,295 --> 00:34:01,097
And a beautiful, young queen,

765
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:02,365
the men are gonna throw themselves

766
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,000
into the fire for you, my dear.

767
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:05,803
They'll shoulder lost causes

768
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:08,672
and take on risks they should never take.

769
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,007
In time, you'll get used to it.

770
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:13,977
You'll know in your
bones the losses you face

771
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:16,313
each time you send men out,
and you'll do it anyway.

772
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,081
It'll be a cold choice.

773
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:20,917
It's mathematical, you could say.

774
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:23,219
Because the only other option is

775
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:25,721
to pull the covers over
your head and give up.

776
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,965
Mary.

777
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,299
I heard what happened.

778
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:39,836
I've been looking for you.

779
00:35:29,513 --> 00:35:32,282
(clears throat) I need Lady Kenna, please.

780
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:42,692
I get headaches.

781
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:47,830
I'm so sorry.

782
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:55,471
(gasping): Your touch...

783
00:35:57,107 --> 00:35:59,775
your touch is so soothing.

784
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,612
I miss your innocence.

785
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:05,014
Your gentleness.

786
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:07,182
Sometimes, Penelope...

787
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:10,018
her voice grates.

788
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,194
Father...

789
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:20,895
Hmm?

790
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,731
- Father...
- Hmm?

791
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,268
I think Queen Penelope's getting jealous.

792
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:28,903
You know how women are around you.

793
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,575
It's a burden sometimes.

794
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,394
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

795
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,129
Because Mary's not here?

796
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,397
I didn't come looking for Mary.

797
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,564
I was worried about you.

798
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,066
Why?

799
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,600
Because you're not safe in this castle.

800
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:03,403
And I will always defend you...

801
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,906
because you're my wife.

802
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,818
I am surprised you're willing to allow

803
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,488
the bodies of your victims
to return to Scotland.

804
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:23,256
Those poor men died in a fire

805
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,958
as anyone can see from what's left of them.

806
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:27,460
Their families deserve

807
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:29,563
the consolation of burying them at home.

808
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:32,231
Mary Queen of...

809
00:37:32,265 --> 00:37:34,967
I hope you're not gonna make
a habit of this bursting in.

810
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:37,003
One day I might be indecent.

811
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:38,705
- (door closes)
- I would like the contract now.

812
00:37:38,772 --> 00:37:39,972
In my hands.

813
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,274
Perhaps you don't
understand what's happened.

814
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:43,976
You lost.

815
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:45,511
Take it with grace.

816
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:46,945
You will give it to me

817
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:48,847
when you hear what I have to say.

818
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:50,649
My dear, there's nothing you can say

819
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:52,518
that can trump the fact I can stop you

820
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:54,386
from getting word of the
contract back to Scotland.

821
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:56,855
Yes.

822
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:59,625
But getting word to France is much easier.

823
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:03,128
Word that the king is mad.

824
00:38:03,196 --> 00:38:06,832
That the House of Valois is ripe to topple.

825
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:09,901
How many dissatisfied nobles,

826
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:13,171
hungry for power, do you think
will step into the vacuum?

827
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,073
You're talking about civil war.

828
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:17,308
Every duke that has a grudge against Henry

829
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:18,877
will be lined up outside of the gate.

830
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:20,044
They'll fight us.

831
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:21,312
They'll fight each other.

832
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,413
- Mary...
- You wouldn't do it.

833
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:23,881
It would destroy France.

834
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,683
You are the Queen of France.

835
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:28,052
I am the Queen of Scotland.

836
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:29,920
You wouldn't harm Francis.

837
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:33,391
Francis is welcome to join
me in Scotland as my consort.

838
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:35,226
Just as I am his consort here.

839
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:36,693
It seems only fair.

840
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:38,229
If I thought you were serious,

841
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,231
you wouldn't leave this room alive.

842
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,166
I sent three riders out this morning.

843
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:45,202
Unless they hear from me

844
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:46,336
with the agreed-upon phrase,

845
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:47,437
they will deliver my letters

846
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,874
to two dukes and to the Vatican.

847
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:54,411
The world will know that
France is open for the taking.

848
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,782
Is she bluffing, Francis?

849
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,718
She's Mary Queen of Scots.

850
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:04,053
I wouldn't like to guess what she would do.

851
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:07,724
You killed 12 of my countrymen.

852
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:10,693
Look into my eyes and
tell me that I'm bluffing.

853
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:28,110
This is the original that
has your signature on it.

854
00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:30,479
Burn it.

855
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,001
<i>FRANCIS: That was quite a bluff</i>

856
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:54,669
you ran against my mother today.

857
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:56,404
Amazing.

858
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,906
I did send out three riders.

859
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,643
To deceive my mother.

860
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:03,311
Well, I'm sure you didn't give them

861
00:40:03,346 --> 00:40:05,780
dangerous messages that
could blow up France.

862
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:08,750
You'd never have done that.

863
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:11,453
But, I did.

864
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,421
What?

865
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:17,491
I'm going to be Queen of France someday.

866
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,028
And I hope to be a good queen.

867
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:22,830
But France has you and your mother

868
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:24,832
to look after her welfare.

869
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,169
Scotland only has me.

870
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:30,804
If it ever becomes a choice
between our two countries,

871
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:33,073
I will chose mine.

872
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:38,245
In whatever way necessary.
