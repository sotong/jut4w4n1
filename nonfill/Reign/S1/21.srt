1
00:00:00,224 --> 00:00:01,459
<i>Previously on Reign...</i>

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,360
You killed someone in the woods

3
00:00:03,376 --> 00:00:06,178
<i>when the pagans forced
you to choose a sacrifice.</i>

4
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:07,879
I murdered a man who was
about to kill another.

5
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:10,115
And to this day I wonder:
did he have a family?

6
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:11,617
I have very powerful uncles.

7
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:12,984
What, the Duke of Guise?

8
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,353
Do you have any idea what you've done?

9
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,288
You just let the devil into our home.

10
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,159
<i>FRANCIS: It's Father.
He's gone utterly mad.</i>

11
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:22,794
You think I'm delusional?

12
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:25,063
French forces marched
for Calais this morning.

13
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:27,298
I need the Duke's army to save France.

14
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,500
We stay and finish this or we die trying.

15
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:31,002
Fire!

16
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:39,610
(crowd cheering)

17
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,059
MARY: Did you see Francis yet?

18
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:56,560
Not yet.

19
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,328
It's strange how, after months of waiting,

20
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:00,530
these last moments are the most agonizing.

21
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,566
What about you? Don't you
want to look for Leith?

22
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,601
He was conscripted so he
wouldn't be punished here.

23
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:06,837
If he survived, he would never return.

24
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,739
It's better that he doesn't.

25
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:11,174
Why isn't Bash here to greet his brother?

26
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,445
He's out in the Blood Wood
again hunting for the Darkness.

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,116
(sighs) Why Bash feels it's his
duty to end this, I don't know.

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,519
I just want him to come home to me.

29
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:25,922
Take me away from court and our mad king.

30
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:28,624
MAN: God save Prince Francis!

31
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:30,693
200 years!

32
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:33,562
For 200 years the English have occupied

33
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:36,199
our port city of Calais, but no longer!

34
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,768
(crowd cheers)

35
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:41,370
Calais is ours once again!

36
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:43,405
(cheering)

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,375
And I am proud to say
that I fought alongside

38
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,378
the bravest soldiers in Europe,

39
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:51,747
And the Duke of Guise, whose men

40
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,816
and bravery helped us achieve victory!

41
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:56,585
(cheering)

42
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:01,757
Mention your father, Francis.

43
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,392
Don't let that son of a bitch do it first.

44
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:07,229
In truth, the real hero of Calais

45
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:09,231
is the man with the vision...

46
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:14,402
of a France free and whole!

47
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:18,339
The man who masterminded this victory!

48
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,976
King Henry Valois!

49
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,279
(crowd cheering)

50
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:27,649
We have our work cut
out for us with that one.

51
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:28,949
Get to it.

52
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:30,818
MAN: King Henry!

53
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,420
Mary.

54
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,288
Francis...

55
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,925
you came back to me. You came back.

56
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,426
God is on our side.

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,030
Not only did we reclaim Calais,
but I have news of my own:

58
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,799
my spies in England have been tracking

59
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:48,102
the queen's slow crawl to the grave.

60
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,704
After countless rumors and endless waiting,

61
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,972
she is dead!

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,677
The queen of England, Mary Tudor, is dead!

63
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,077
(crowd cheering)

64
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,015
The Tudor queen betrayed
the Catholic Church,

65
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,186
her own faith, by naming
a Protestant to the throne.

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,990
But God's will reigns.

67
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:16,296
We will take the time
to relish our victories,

68
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,332
knowing that one day England will be ours,

69
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,336
crushed and then reborn
under its rightful queen,

70
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,671
Mary Stuart!

71
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,940

I overheard the servants complaining

00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,901
when I brought in the logs.

97
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,136
I don't think they've
come across many noblemen

98
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,172
who enjoy cutting their own firewood.

99
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:12,074
I find it charming.

100
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:17,880
And this home?

101
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:21,283
Our home? Do you find it charming as well?

102
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:22,851
It's lovely.

103
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:25,620
I'm thrilled it was available
on such short notice.

104
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:28,090
But I would ultimately
like to find something

105
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,758
further from court.

106
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,393
You said you would as well.

107
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:34,463
Not Hungary; I know you've tired
of the weather in your homeland.

108
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:35,797
I crave a warmer climate.

109
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:37,566
But... but you...

110
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:40,435
Why are you so eager to put
distance between you and court?

111
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,405
Is there someone there you hope to avoid?

112
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,808
Lola, you can tell me the truth.

113
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:48,577
Are you worried about a resemblance?

114
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:53,314
Your hair is so dark and lovely.

115
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:55,083
So is yours.

116
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,587
The child will likely be
fairer than either of us.

117
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:02,090
Ah. Well, uh,

118
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:04,025
many dark-haired people
have fair-haired children.

119
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,760
No one will know the child isn't mine.

120
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:08,496
Because I will be

121
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,698
the happiest and proudest
father and husband

122
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,766
anyone has ever seen.

123
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:21,208
- Mary...
- Not yet.

124
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,811
If we could lie here a little longer.

125
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,246
Just a few more moments

126
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:28,048
with nothing else to think about

127
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:29,716
except each other.

128
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:31,485
I know you have grave reservations.

129
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:37,590
But today you are faced with the
news that Mary Tudor has died.

130
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,060
The world will be looking
to you for your response.

131
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:43,262
And if I shall stake my claim to England.

132
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,998
Elizabeth will be looking.

133
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:48,701
She knows that she's most
vulnerable to your claim now

134
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,336
before her coronation,

135
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,371
before she consolidates her power.

136
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,040
It's a brief window of opportunity

137
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:56,609
that my father seems keen

138
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:57,876
to take advantage of.

139
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:00,712
If I stake my claim, there will be war.

140
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,283
I will be declaring myself
my cousin's enemy for life.

141
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:06,352
I just want it all to go away.

142
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,886
I don't want to think about England,

143
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:09,555
or my cousin, or my half brother

144
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:12,391
and his lords who now control Scotland.

145
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:15,928
I've just got you back.

146
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:18,697
I want us to have a
chance to love each other.

147
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:27,539
You told me once that you
would support whatever decision

148
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,374
I made in regards to England.

149
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,642
Is that still true?

150
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:34,745
I will stand by you.

151
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,515
You can count on me, as I count on you.

152
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:41,519
I'm thinking of writing my cousin a letter.

153
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,660
BASH: Did you find anything?

154
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:52,997
More sacrifices 50 paces back.

155
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,700
They've been dead for a few days.

156
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:59,103
My lord, it grows darker.

157
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:12,882
It's an eclipse. Don't be afraid.

158
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,590
It's blood.

159
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,526
Fresh blood.

160
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,228
Another sacrifice to the Darkness?

161
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,675
Don't touch him.

162
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,944
That boy came out of the shadows.

163
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,078
He's cold as ice.

164
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,254
(high-pitched whistle)

165
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,224
It's all right! It's all
right! It's all right!

166
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,460
I'm not going to hurt you! It's all right!

167
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,629
You're safe now. My name is Sebastian

168
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,465
and I want to help you. What's your name?

169
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:09,638
This whistle, I know what it means,

170
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:12,240
and it strikes fear in my heart, too.

171
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,476
Where did you get it?

172
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:15,677
Have you seen him?

173
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:17,011
Have you seen the Darkness?

174
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,881
Don't bring him back with us, my lord.

175
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:21,516
That child will take us all to hell.

176
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,418
No, he won't.

177
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,453
He'll take us to the Darkness.

178
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,287
(clears throat)

179
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,823
Welcome.

180
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,958
I got your message. You said you wanted

181
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,292
to discuss business?

182
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,261
Gabrielle, if you don't mind.

183
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,500
Shall I return later?

184
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:46,900
Not tonight, beauty.

185
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:55,009
You on the other hand...

186
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:59,647
why don't you come back here
when you finish your chores?

187
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:03,183
An interesting choice.

188
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:05,653
Assuming you let her know she has one

189
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,454
since she's a servant and you're a duke.

190
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,222
I'll let her know.

191
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,324
I liked her.

192
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:15,061
And she's certainly a step up
from one of Catherine's spies.

193
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,697
I wanted to discuss this letter you wrote

194
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,566
to Elizabeth of England.

195
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,170
At least three people
read every letter you send,

196
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:25,004
even the ones delivered
through private messengers.

197
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,706
You think I don't know that?

198
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,175
And why do you question my word?

199
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,676
Your letter states

200
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,978
that you want peace with
your cousin and her country.

201
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,412
And for that, you're willing to

202
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:35,247
relinquish your claim on England forever.

203
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:37,516
A thought suited for another world.

204
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:39,018
But we live in this one.

205
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,821
If I stake my claim,

206
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:44,724
thousands of people will
die to try and make it good.

207
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:45,925
Either Elizabeth or I will lose our heads.

208
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,993
And for what?!

209
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:48,194
I'm already Queen of Scotland.

210
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:49,928
I'm going to be Queen of France.

211
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:51,930
Isn't that enough? So
you're willing to disarm,

212
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:54,533
hoping your opponent will disarm?

213
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:55,767
Here's what you should know:

214
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,070
when you disarm, your opponent shoots you.

215
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,372
We're not at war.

216
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:01,840
Royals are always at war.

217
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,008
Why?

218
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,376
Why must I join in this madness?

219
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:08,513
I can be a good wife to Francis
and a good queen to his country.

220
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:11,183
You can never have a normal life

221
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,618
because of who you are, and without power

222
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:15,520
you're nothing but a threat.

223
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:20,025
Mary. The truth is, you're still
simply a guest at French court.

224
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,760
The wife of the Dauphin.

225
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:25,697
You must beg the king and queen
for anything Scotland may need.

226
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:29,367
All your power comes from what
you might do in the future.

227
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,537
This is your only card.

228
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:34,138
Once you play it...

229
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:37,307
it's gone.

230
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:38,582
(footsteps rapidly approaching)

231
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,684
KENNA: Bash. There you are.

232
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:40,985
Why are you...?

233
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:43,020
Who's this?

234
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,322
We found him in the woods,
alone and covered in blood.

235
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,593
He won't say a word about
what happened to him.

236
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,328
The blood isn't his.

237
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,997
He has no cuts, no bite marks,

238
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:56,633
nothing to match the other
victims of the Darkness.

239
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,735
What makes you think the
child encountered him?

240
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:00,337
He was carrying this;

241
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:01,905
it's a kind of pagan whistle.

242
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,240
I've heard it twice before, and both times

243
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,841
the Darkness was nearby.

244
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,679
I think he uses it as a
warning to inspire fear.

245
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,013
Well, if it belongs to the Darkness,

246
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,848
how did this child get a hold of it?

247
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,617
You must have got close to him.

248
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:15,885
Was your family chosen?

249
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,520
Were they sacrificed?

250
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:18,621
Can you tell us where you were?

251
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,023
Enough!

252
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,158
Leave the boy alone.
He's been through hell;

253
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:23,426
you don't need to hold him over the coals.

254
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,962
Are you hurt?

255
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,899
No one will hurt you here. I promise.

256
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:36,205
The child knows something.

257
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:37,640
He's just too frightened to speak.

258
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,041
To you;

259
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:40,876
he's afraid of you.

260
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:43,378
Perhaps the situation requires
a more delicate approach.

261
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:49,752
From the duke I learned nothing.

262
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,687
Well, nothing of political interest.

263
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,426
But this morning I bed
one of his lieutenants,

264
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,962
who was curious to see what attractions

265
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,063
I held for his master.

266
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,798
(quietly laughs)

267
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,833
Men.

268
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,802
It always works.

269
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,337
And was he more forthcoming?

270
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,139
- Much.
- Mm.

271
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,642
He says King Henry refuses to delay

272
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,277
while supplies and armies
are being replenished.

273
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,412
He will not wait on England.

274
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,748
They've just returned from war.

275
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:23,450
Henry said they'd take
time to celebrate Calais.

276
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:25,452
Mobilization has already begun.

277
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,755
The offices are being sworn to secrecy.

278
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,158
The king means to attack
England within the week.

279
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:33,093
He wants to slay Elizabeth

280
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:36,196
and put Mary on the throne then.

281
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,999
BARTOS: Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Lord Julien.

282
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,267
Will you tell him his Uncle Bartos

283
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:41,602
is here to see him?

284
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:42,869
BENJAMIN: Yes, sir.

285
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,471
(door closes, footsteps approach)

286
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:47,274
Oh, Bartos! (laughs)

287
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,942
How good to see you.

288
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:50,777
You look positively road-weary.

289
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,145
Please, come in.

290
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,479
Thank you. Leave us. We're fine here.

291
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:55,816
- Would the gentlemen...?
- We're fine.

292
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,983
What's all the fuss?

293
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:58,051
And when did we get so familiar?

294
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,652
(door closes)

295
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,222
I'm not here to be
reunited with a secretary;

296
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:04,357
I want to talk to my nephew directly.

297
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:06,826
Remy...

298
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,062
where is he? Where is Lord Julien?

299
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,331
Uh-uh, Lord Julien's away.

300
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:12,945
Where?

301
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,194
He's been out of touch
with the family for months

302
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:18,097
gallivanting all over the
continent for nearly a year.

303
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:20,166
The family sent me here

304
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,001
to find him, after we heard a rumor

305
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,435
he'd been married at French court.

306
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:26,371
It's true, he's both
married and with child.

307
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:27,907
He's hard to keep in check,

308
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:29,842
but I'll start at the tavern he favors.

309
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,510
Uh, wh... where are you staying?

310
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:34,213
I'll come around with Julien
as soon as I track him down.

311
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,982
He's evading his family, I don't know why,

312
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,384
but those who finance his disregard

313
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,619
deserve an explanation.

314
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:44,523
I'll wait right here...

315
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:45,590
for his return.

316
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:48,327
(sighs)

317
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,895
(door closes)

318
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,297
I have to tell you something.

319
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:53,465
I have to do it quickly

320
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,700
and you have to hear everything I say

321
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:55,867
beyond something that'll shock you.

322
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:57,568
I don't understand.

323
00:14:57,602 --> 00:15:00,571
I love you. That is who I
am, the man who loves you,

324
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:01,539
but I'm not Lord Julien.

325
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:04,242
What are you talking about?

326
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:06,811
My real name is Remy.

327
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,480
I was Lord Julien's personal
secretary before he died.

328
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:11,915
This is madness.

329
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,352
(sighing)

330
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:18,188
The real Julien Varga
died in a terrible fire.

331
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:19,724
We were traveling through Bavaria.

332
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:21,392
The inn we stopped at burned to the ground.

333
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,061
I was carrying Julien's
cloak, with its crest.

334
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:27,998
The local magistrate assumed I was he.

335
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,167
His life was there for the taking.

336
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:32,102
So I took it.

337
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,172
I took it and then I met
you and I gave you a life...

338
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:37,241
I gave us a life...

339
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:38,742
- a wonderful life.
- For his money,

340
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:42,012
is that it? You... you robbed a dead man?

341
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,447
Yes. It was a decision made in the moment,

342
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:46,683
because I saw suddenly
how easy it could be.

343
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,753
He has a family far away,
whom he hated and rarely saw,

344
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,020
money he could never use.

345
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,356
So I let the stipends keep coming.

346
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:54,957
But, eventually, they wanted contact

347
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,459
with their wandering son,
they wanted to see him.

348
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,294
And then you met me.

349
00:15:58,328 --> 00:15:59,629
Good timing, was it?

350
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:00,897
Because the stipends got cut off?

351
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:02,064
Do I have that right?

352
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:03,432
Yes.

353
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:04,433
You were going to fleece me

354
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:05,434
for all you could

355
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,370
and then run from your crime.

356
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,805
The story you told about being

357
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:11,707
disenfranchised from your family,

358
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,543
it all makes sense; they
weren't your family at all.

359
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,979
Did you murder him?

360
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:19,281
No. No. I did not.

361
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:23,084
You might think I'm the
lowest form of grave robber,

362
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,553
but I didn't kill him.

363
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:26,988
And while I planned to leave you, I didn't.

364
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:29,291
I stayed, because I fell in love with you.

365
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:31,760
I risked everything to be with you.

366
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:34,396
I risked this day, which
I prayed would never come.

367
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,663
Have you been caught?

368
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,065
Is that why you're telling me this now?

369
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:40,501
There is a man in the other room.

370
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,771
He is Lord Julien's uncle,
sent by the family to find him.

371
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,506
You can hate me for the rest of your life.

372
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,242
You can turn me in to the authorities.

373
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:50,912
All I ask is that you back me up

374
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:53,481
for as long as it takes to
get him out of this house

375
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,316
and out of our lives.

376
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,118
I don't know who you are.

377
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,422
But I'm not sure I want him to leave,

378
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:03,958
because you terrify me.

379
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,127
You're sure?

380
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,597
He could just be mobilizing against

381
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,099
a counterattack on Calais.

382
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,533
A naval commander's confirmed it.

383
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:16,470
Henry has ordered a fleet
to set sail for England

384
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:17,938
by week's end.

385
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:19,473
You've seen the state of the French army.

386
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,208
If Henry invades...

387
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:24,110
We will be slaughtered.

388
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,112
After Calais, we are
depleted on all fronts.

389
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,147
There must be some way to reach him.

390
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,416
Francis...

391
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:34,287
Henry doesn't understand
right from wrong, or care.

392
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,190
He's killed innocents, he's shut out

393
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:40,726
his closest advisors, he's
closed his mind to reason.

394
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,320
No one can get through to him.

395
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,164
This has gone on long
enough; he has to be stopped.

396
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,568
No. Absolutely not.

397
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,804
Don't get sentimental
about a father who was never

398
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,540
<i>- sentimental about you.
- But he is my father,</i>

399
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,042
and the king of France.

400
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,643
We owe him our allegiance.

401
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,678
Or how can we expect it ourselves?

402
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,680
He is sick. He needs our help,

403
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,383
not to be put down like some rabid dog.

404
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,686
I need to get him away from
here, away from the castle,

405
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,522
take him somewhere.

406
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,990
- A hunting trip.
- CATHERINE: A hunting trip?

407
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,993
- That's your solution?
- We have said before that

408
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,761
he may be being poisoned here in the castle

409
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,730
by a means we have not yet discovered.

410
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,598
We have ruled out poison.

411
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,600
I am not convinced.

412
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,703
I know what he has done
and what he has become...

413
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,273
but I need one last chance
to break through to him.

414
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,642
I need to make sure that
I have tried everything.

415
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,177
All right.

416
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,879
But whatever you plan

417
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,749
on doing, do it quickly...
we are running out of time.

418
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,117
<i>I will reach him.</i>

419
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:50,227
You know as well as I do
there's no reaching Henry.

420
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,628
He's gone.

421
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:54,631
We promised Francis time. The time is now.

422
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,734
Catherine, I can't.

423
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:00,604
I... I'd be defying my husband...

424
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,807
<i>- betraying him, murdering his father.
- My husband...</i>

425
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,142
<i>the father of my children...</i>

426
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,713
<i>handing over my crown to you
the moment Francis is king.</i>

427
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:12,248
I can't think about myself.

428
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:15,418
We need to think like queens now.

429
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,420
Or thousands of men will die needlessly

430
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:20,423
in a war we are not prepared
for and we cannot win.

431
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:24,260
We cannot save Henry, but
we can still save those men.

432
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,429
And we can spare Francis

433
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,398
from having to be a part

434
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,633
of his father's murder.

435
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,668
There is some truth in that.

436
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,337
(laughs): And a strange kind of mercy.

437
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,238
So it's settled, then.

438
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,940
Together...

439
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,910
you and I are going to
kill the king of France.

440
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:48,184
REMY: I realize we've talked
around your nephew's absence today.

441
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:50,520
Yes, you've introduced
me to his very silent

442
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:52,255
new wife. Forgive my directness,

443
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,857
but I'd appreciate some of the same.

444
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,128
Where are the servants? I, uh,

445
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:01,230
sent them home... as the truth

446
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:03,599
is a delicate matter.

447
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,768
Lord Julien's been gone for some time.

448
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:07,904
It was an issue of money.

449
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:09,338
He had, uh,

450
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,740
- gambling debts.
- I knew he enjoyed cards...

451
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:14,310
REMY: It was rather a passion for him.

452
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:16,645
One that sadly took precedence
over the passion he had

453
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,246
for his wife.

454
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:19,681
He was...

455
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,417
deeply in debt

456
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:23,419
and fled from those debts.

457
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:25,888
My nephew abandoned you?

458
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:27,523
REMY: I... I can assure you, the love he

459
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:30,158
bore his wife is true, and
that this is excruciating

460
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:32,994
- for Lady Lola to discuss.
- Is that so?

461
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:35,696
How can anyone be sure of
someone who lies so easily,

462
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:37,865
who uses others for
what they can offer him,

463
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,000
regardless of the cost?

464
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:40,835
- Lola...
- The cost is to me,

465
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,337
to my reputation, to my faith in another,

466
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:44,306
in my husband, a man I gave my heart to.

467
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,207
REMY: I assure you

468
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:48,410
I can speak to his heart, torn apart daily

469
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:50,511
as his feelings for you grew.

470
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,914
BARTOS: And I can speak for the family.

471
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:57,051
I had no idea about the depth
of my nephew's gambling problems.

472
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:58,586
To see you left in this way.

473
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,888
I feel shame for my nephew.

474
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:04,559
I assure you, the family will
take care of you financially.

475
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,494
And the child.

476
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,662
You make a passionate case.

477
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:11,094
If only Julien had your depth of feeling.

478
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:16,543
If that's all there is to be said for now?

479
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:18,372
Yes.

480
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,806
For now.

481
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:24,478
I must return home and
alert the rest of the family.

482
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,346
Remy, if you see Julien...

483
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,115
Oh, of... of course.

484
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:31,150
Wait.

485
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:32,586
Is that Julien's ring?

486
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:34,588
What? (chuckles)

487
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:37,390
That's Julien's signet ring.

488
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,860
Why are you wearing my nephew's ring?

489
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:46,432
You see? You're not so
scary under all that blood.

490
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:47,833
We really should get you a proper bath

491
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:50,503
and some lovely covers to sleep under.

492
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:52,530
You know, when I was a little girl,

493
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:55,399
my mother had a blanket made of fleece.

494
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:56,967
How do you stay warm?

495
00:21:57,002 --> 00:21:59,436
Do your parents let you sleep beside them?

496
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:01,038
Where are you parents?

497
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,306
They must be worried
that you're cold or hurt.

498
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,009
They're dead.

499
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,747
I'm sorry.

500
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:12,315
But you needn't fear that they're worrying.

501
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:13,950
I'm sure they're looking at you right now.

502
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,153
And they can see that you're safe.

503
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,987
Can you tell me what happened to them?

504
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:20,890
Then will you tell me what happened to you?

505
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,892
So we can make sure it
never happens to anyone else.

506
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,828
Visegard.

507
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:28,831
What?

508
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,767
What's "Visegard"?

509
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,734
BOY: A bad place in the mountains.

510
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:34,069
He took me there.

511
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,503
Who did?

512
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:38,073
The man with the sharp teeth.

513
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,178
MARY: He's on a hunt.

514
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:46,148
- He could have an accident on his way back.
- What, a stray arrow?

515
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:48,817
No, it's too dangerous
with Francis at his side.

516
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,185
What about poison?

517
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:51,986
Could you get something past his tasters?

518
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,788
I tried that recently.

519
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:55,122
It backfired.

520
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,625
I can't see a way.

521
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:02,763
I've never known you to
wilt from a challenge.

522
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,865
Certainly not when you were
trying to get rid of me.

523
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,669
You're a very

524
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:08,569
imaginative murderer. There must be a way.

525
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:15,509
There is one time to get to him.

526
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:17,178
<i>Communion.</i>

527
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:19,346
<i>He's been taking mass alone.</i>

528
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,515
<i>There are no tasters, no guards.</i>

529
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:24,551
<i>And he feels absolutely safe.</i>

530
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,721
These are for a private mass.

531
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:30,624
<i>CATHERINE: Just him, a
priest and the Almighty God.</i>

532
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:34,461
We will have one chance at this.

533
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:36,830
We won't get another.

534
00:23:36,864 --> 00:23:37,997
And if we succeed,

535
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:41,801
I'll be a widow.

536
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:44,804
And Francis will rule.

537
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,574
Long live the king.

538
00:23:54,253 --> 00:23:56,087
I've never heard of any
town called Visegard.

539
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,356
What do you hope to find there?

540
00:23:58,391 --> 00:23:59,892
The boy was neither
sacrificed nor fed upon.

541
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:01,894
Yet the Darkness brought
him there for some reason.

542
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:03,328
If we find this place, it may hold clues.

543
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:05,796
It may even be a place
the Darkness resides.

544
00:24:05,831 --> 00:24:08,333
And what makes you think that?

545
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:09,767
When pagans spill blood
to feed the Darkness,

546
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,069
they have to bring it somewhere.

547
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:12,803
You don't even know where this town is.

548
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:16,607
It could be days away.

549
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:18,176
You said that when you
return, that you would take me

550
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:20,578
to our new home, that you
would get me away from Henry.

551
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:22,312
Perhaps I should leave you.

552
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,515
No, we have business still.

553
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,917
You're right.

554
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:26,984
Pack your things.

555
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:28,452
We'll leave tonight.

556
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:36,393
I'll think of some excuse.

557
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:38,062
You're not planning to go with her?

558
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,896
I can't involve her in this.

559
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:42,533
If I tell her what I know, I
have to tell her how I know it.

560
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,435
How you know what exactly?

561
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:46,103
That Visegard is more than just a place.

562
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:47,438
It's a pagan word.

563
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,506
It means "Where Darkness rises."

564
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:53,877
And that I know this
because I was born a pagan.

565
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:56,613
Is that why you've taken this on?

566
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:59,415
Because you feel some blame for
the blood spilled by this faith?

567
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,051
It's more than just that.

568
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:03,587
I was forced to kill
two men in those woods...

569
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,790
a zealot of the faith and an innocent.

570
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:09,759
And ever since then, I have

571
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:11,927
a darkness in me that I despise.

572
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:14,397
The Darkness touched us all.

573
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,199
It tortured Olivia.

574
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,534
If you're going to search for Visegard,

575
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:21,571
I'm going with you.

576
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,540
There is nothing quite like

577
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:25,941
the feast of a fresh kill.

578
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:28,410
I feel cleaner.

579
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,778
Stronger.

580
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:31,513
Ready to take on England.

581
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:37,086
But to stage an invasion now,

582
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,955
before we have replenished our forces,

583
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,758
is it not better to wait?

584
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,435
You know, Francis...

585
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:57,172
we should have done this a long time ago.

586
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:02,576
All those hunting trips I
shared with your brother,

587
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:05,179
I regret not having had
these moments with you.

588
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,253
Why do you push so hard to conquer England?

589
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,591
Perhaps I am...

590
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:20,261
more ambitious than most kings.

591
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:23,497
It was my father who
taught me to push hard.

592
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:28,702
Oh, he expected a great deal from his sons.

593
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,238
Did you know he was
captured by the Spaniards?

594
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,843
I was six or seven at the time.

595
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,845
They imprisoned him in Madrid,

596
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,315
under the cruelest conditions.

597
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:45,518
One day, my brother and
I were taken to visit him.

598
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:48,855
He saw our boat and he ran to us.

599
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,024
I ran to him.

600
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,927
He passed us by and jumped in the boat.

601
00:26:54,995 --> 00:27:00,166
We'd been traded as
hostages for his freedom.

602
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:04,204
Why did he let that happen?

603
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:11,443
He was the one who arranged it.

604
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:19,185
Sons must sacrifice

605
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:21,120
for their fathers.

606
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:24,256
This is the lesson.

607
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:29,027
I learned it with my brother,

608
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:31,162
beaten and starved for three years.

609
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,333
Father...

610
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,801
When we returned...

611
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:41,873
there was no loving embrace.

612
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,615
He was a hard man to please.

613
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:55,186
Like God.

614
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:01,292
Father, it wasn't right.

615
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,629
What he did to you, it wasn't right.

616
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:09,130
I believe in a loving God.

617
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:14,104
And I believe His work is
done by people like you,

618
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:16,439
and you have so much more to do in France

619
00:28:16,474 --> 00:28:19,709
before you turn to England.

620
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:23,280
You have already achieved the glory.

621
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,015
Now do the good.

622
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,121
Yes, of course.

623
00:28:32,156 --> 00:28:37,026
There are things to do in France first.

624
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:40,688
I tell you, he asked me
to keep the ring so that

625
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:41,789
he wouldn't gamble away a family keepsake.

626
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:43,624
Bartos, what are you looking for?

627
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:46,126
BARTOS: Julien is a
large man. I see no boots

628
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:48,462
his size, no cloaks that would fit him.

629
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:50,664
There's no trace of my nephew anywhere.

630
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:53,400
You're making an ordeal out of nothing.

631
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:55,502
BENJAMIN: Begging your pardon,
mistress, I left my gloves...

632
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,903
LOLA: Not now, Benjamin.

633
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:59,139
BENJAMIN: As they're my only pair...

634
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:01,508
- Please be on your way.
- You there. You work

635
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,243
for the master of this house, do you not?

636
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,512
- This is a private matter. Just go.
- Where is he?

637
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:07,581
Where is Lord Julien?

638
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:10,083
He's standing right there.

639
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:12,351
But this man is...

640
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,855
this man...

641
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,891
And this woman?

642
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:18,959
BENJAMIN: His wife,

643
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,827
my lord, Lady Lola.

644
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:23,729
Get out, Benjamin. Just go.

645
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,499
You took my nephew's name.

646
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,234
- What else did you take?
- I never harmed him.

647
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,836
- I promise you.
- Remy, just tell him what happened.

648
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,672
Is he still alive? Answer me.

649
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:35,908
It was an accident, I swear...

650
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:36,775
You killed him.

651
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,910
LOLA: No, no, no!

652
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:40,112
Let go, let go! Stop it! Stop it, please!

653
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:41,680
- I'll kill you...
- Let go of him!

My God.

657
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,124
I killed him.

658
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,861
I have to go now. I'm moving today.

659
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,930
But I wanted you to know that these
ladies are going to look after you.

660
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,933
They're the kindest
governesses in the castle.

661
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,935
It's for the best.

662
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,605
They're gonna take much better
care of you than I ever could.

663
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:13,310
Um, my mother gave this
to me when I left Scotland.

664
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,546
She said it would always keep me safe.

665
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,850
I wanted you to have it.

666
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,286
Please don't leave me.

667
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,756
They'll burn me.

668
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,893
Go.

669
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,463
Why would you say that?

670
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,901
You worship the gods,

671
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,405
not God, don't you?

672
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,574
I don't care if you're a pagan.

673
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:46,009
I'm never going to let anybody hurt you.

674
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:49,345
Would you like to come and stay with me?

675
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,748
Just for a while?

676
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,118
You know, I don't even know your name.

677
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,455
Pascal.

678
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,857
Mary, I did it.

679
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:04,960
- What?
- I convinced him to postpone the invasion.

680
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:06,962
France is safe.

681
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:08,631
He listened to me.

682
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,600
His sanity started trickling back in,

683
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,102
and for a moment I could
actually see my father again.

684
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,207
I'm not saying that he's cured.

685
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,709
That may take time.

686
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:22,311
What is it? What's wrong?

687
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,182
How much time?

688
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:27,449
How can you be sure?

689
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,451
- I'm not.
- Then you agree,

690
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,286
- we can't risk it.
- Risk what?

691
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:32,888
Letting him live?

692
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:38,227
Mary... what have you done?

693
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:46,801
<i>FRANCIS: It's not too late!</i>

694
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:49,838
He has agreed not to invade England!

695
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:51,072
He saw reason!

696
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:52,306
He's getting better!

697
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:53,641
Do you hear me?!

698
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,176
Well, if there's hope, maybe.

699
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:56,878
There is hope! I've seen it!

700
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:58,780
You have to stop this right now!

701
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:04,986
<i>In nomine patri et fili</i>

Who?!

708
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:43,780
MAN: Your Majesty, the Duke of Guise.

709
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,817
My friend! You're the only one I can trust.

710
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:50,020
I must speak with you.

711
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:52,322
Alone.

712
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,391
<i>FRANCIS: I thought your
plan was to poison him.</i>

713
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:56,660
It was. I stopped it. I
got to the priest in time.

714
00:32:56,694 --> 00:32:57,794
I don't understand.

715
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:59,095
If you didn't send the assassin, who did?

716
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,464
I don't know. But I can't help but notice

717
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:02,999
who's benefited the most.

718
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:05,301
Who's come out of this
smelling like a rose.

719
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:07,704
My uncle.

720
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,072
<i>How did he know the specifics of our plan?</i>

721
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:11,074
<i>That we called it off?</i>

722
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:12,641
<i>CATHERINE: He has spies, surely.</i>

723
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:14,743
<i>What if he's playing both sides?</i>

724
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:18,081
What if he warned the king
of an attempt on his life?

725
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:20,883
If we succeed in spite of this, job done:

726
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:23,586
Francis becomes king and the duke benefits

727
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:25,588
from his promise of a position at court.

728
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:26,956
If we fail...

729
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:28,558
Then the duke is the
man who warned the king.

730
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:32,461
He still benefits because
he gains my father's trust.

731
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:36,564
The only complication was
our calling off the attempt.

732
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,600
The duke's already warned the king;

733
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:41,970
he looks like a hysterical
fool if nothing happens.

734
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:44,706
So he makes something happen.

735
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,208
Sometimes, to sell a pail
of water, you start a fire.

736
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,878
If this is true, then the
king will listen to no one

737
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,146
but the duke from now on.

738
00:33:52,214 --> 00:33:53,714
<i>He was listening to me.</i>

739
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,416
Do you both realize how
much danger you're in

740
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,917
because of what you've done?

741
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,386
The good news is we're both still alive,

742
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:01,989
so Henry doesn't suspect us... yet.

743
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:04,791
But his paranoia is awakened.

744
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,560
We'll never get another chance.

745
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,029
Henry's untouchable now.

746
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,532
God help us all.

747
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:17,403
I lie behind the star-bright sky,

748
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:19,439
I do not fear this life's good-bye.

749

that's all right with you.

As will you. These men will escort you home

752
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:31,851

hurt you again. I promise.

00:36:54,957 --> 00:36:57,492
So am I.

818
00:36:57,526 --> 00:37:00,162
We haven't much time.

819
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:02,297
The servants could return at any moment.

820
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:03,631
Go back to French Court.

821
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,267
Don't be alone.

822
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,836
There are too many challenges ahead of you.

823
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,739
If the real father is a good man,

824
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:14,475
let him be a part of your lives.

825
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,577
Promise me that.

826
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,120
Go now, my love.

827
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:28,689
Don't look back.

828
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:39,099
Promise me you'll run.

829
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,601
I'll run for my life.

830
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,448
♪

831
00:37:57,084 --> 00:38:00,619
PASCAL: I lie behind the star-bright sky,

832
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,857
I do not fear this life's good-bye.

833
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:07,060
Close your eyes for my caress.

834
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:09,695
I've never heard that rhyme before.

835
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,697
Who taught it to you?

836
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:13,399
My father.

837
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:17,470
Do you want to tell me what
happened to your father?

838
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,472
A bad man killed him.

839
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,039
(swords clash, men grunting)

840
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:23,409
(grunting continues)

841
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,348
I think you're ignorant.

842
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,817
I think the bloodlust

843
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:33,785
is in you.

844
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,953
(yells)

845
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:41,894
<i>KENNA: Whoever killed him
will someday be punished.</i>

846
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:45,931
Bad men always get what they deserve.

847
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:47,699
(bell tolling)

848
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,001
(wind whistles softly)

849
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:53,371
Francis, Henry had to be stopped.

850
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:55,991
It wasn't an easy decision to make,

851
00:38:55,993 --> 00:38:57,305
but I thought it was the only way.

852
00:38:57,316 --> 00:39:00,812
<i>I know what you thought,
but you agreed to wait.</i>

853
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,715
You lied to me.

854
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:05,249
I'm sorry.

855
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:08,185
Sorry for what?

856
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:10,421
You don't regret it... we both know

857
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:12,556
that you'd do it again.

858
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,757
When you told me that you wanted

859
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,326
to relinquish your claim to England,

860
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,561
I stood by you, and today
when I told you what I wanted,

861
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:19,130
I thought you stood by me as well.

862
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:21,365
Instead, you worked with my mother

863
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:22,933
to murder the king of France!

864
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,036
We wanted to spare you.

865
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:29,205
I didn't want you to carry

866
00:39:29,273 --> 00:39:31,475
that burden for the rest of your life.

867
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,444
I did what you couldn't do.

868
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:35,111
I did it for France.

869
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,047
For the nation that you used to put

870
00:39:37,114 --> 00:39:38,614
before all else, even me.

871
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:40,616
Because that is what rulers do!

872
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:42,652
- What is wrong with you?!
- (gasps)

873
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,587
He is my father!

874
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:50,427
There are risks that you take...

875
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:52,996
for the people that you love.

876
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:55,097
You used to know that.

877
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,435
Who are you becoming?

878
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:04,874
<i>HENRY: It was good to
be with Francis today.</i>

879
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:09,712
The boy truly loves me,
I understand that now.

880
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:14,016
I have misjudged him...

881
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,018
in so many ways.

882
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:17,752
He doesn't want England.

883
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:19,621
He shies from conquest.

884
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:21,923
Without my constant
pushing, he would be content

885
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,759
to hide under the covers with Mary.

886
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:27,996
I can't live in fear...

887
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,631
or tolerate it in others.

888
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:32,200
<i>I was so close to death
today, I could feel...</i>

889
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:35,604
its dark hand on my throat.

890
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,707
But God...

891
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:42,844
spared me for the work I must do.

892
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,379
It is for me

893
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:46,381
to sit on England's throne,

894
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:50,118
to slay their bastard
queen, and rule a new empire!

895
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:52,853
It's what I was meant for!

896
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:55,223
(panting)

897
00:40:55,257 --> 00:40:56,524
But...

898
00:40:56,558 --> 00:40:58,859
Francis was right.

899
00:40:58,894 --> 00:41:01,729
Before I... I invade England...

900
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:05,599
there are things I must do here in France.

901
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:12,573
First...

902
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:15,809
I must kill my son...

903
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:19,179
and wed his wife.

904
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:35,000
