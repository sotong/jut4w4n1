1
00:00:01,743 --> 00:00:03,977
<i>- Previously on Reign...
- You killed 12 of my countrymen.</i>

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:06,713
- (yells)
- I will never forgive you for this.

3
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:09,115
Lord Castleroy, I heard
what you did for Leith.

4
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:11,217
<i>Getting him out of jail, into the army.</i>

5
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:13,920
<i>CASTLEROY: I didn't do it
for him. I did it for you.</i>

6
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:15,721
My mother is a Catholic ally.

7
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:18,324
She is under attack. Enemies
screaming for her head.

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,459
- And no one cares.
- But the Duke of Guise?

9
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:22,495
<i>MARY: Do you know anyone
else with an army as large?</i>

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,729
- Or as loyal?
- Your men will report to me

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,970
as they would to you.

12
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:28,434
- But why would you need my men...?
- I'm going with you to Scotland.

13
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,903
French forces marched
for Calais this morning.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,137
Henry, you're not well.

15
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:33,873
We can take Calais.

16
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,508
Any fool knows he can't do that.

17
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:37,676
It's true, Father's army
would failon its own...

18
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,345
but two armies...

19
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,980
Do you mean the duke's army? Mary's army?

20
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:44,649
Mary will have to
understand. I have no choice.

21
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:47,119
Francis is trying to save his country.

22
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:49,988
<i>And I can forgive him for that
as I hope he will forgive me</i>

23
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:52,190
for doing what needs
to be done for Scotland.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,694
(crows squawking)

25
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,931
MAN: The English attacked at dawn.

26
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:02,754
It took almost everything we had,

27
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,323
but we beat them back.

28
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,992
Between the constant
attacks and desertions,

29
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,961
we won't be able to hold the line.

30
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,396
Where's your commander?

31
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:12,398
Dead. Who's asking?

32
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:13,765
The Dauphin of France.

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,267
Stand when you address him.

34
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:20,171
The English have been on our
soil in Calais for two centuries.

35
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,607
I, for one, am tired

36
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,942
of seeing them attack our lines.

37
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,144
I'm sure you are, too.

38
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,814
That's why you're not gonna
hold this outpost anymore.

39
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,215
You're going to advance.

40
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:31,749
But we've lost half our company.

41
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:33,318
The English know that.

42
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,352
That's why they keep attacking,

43
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,386
taking a few of us each time,

44
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,188
until we can't fight anymore

45
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,490
and are forced to retreat.

46
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,724
We're in danger of losing this war

47
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,958
if we don't act.

48
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,361
The soldiers that you repelled

49
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,396
this morning come from
the castle of Montmorency.

50
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:48,899
That castle stands between
us and our route to Calais.

51
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,201
If we take it, we clear the way.

52
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,570
So the Duke of Guise can
stop holding the English back

53
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,405
on the eastern front,
and push his men through

54
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,307
where the English aren't
prepared to defend themselves.

55
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,877
He has thousands of men.

56
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,411
But there's 12 of us.

57
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,714
You want us to take a castle?

58
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,315
Not you alone.

59
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,484
All the men along the
line will advance as well.

60
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:09,819
My Lord, Your Grace.

61
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,189
The English have been
spotted, headed this way.

62
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,357
We need to get you to safety.

63
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,092
So much for advancing to a bloody castle.

64
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,428
Send word to the duke.

65
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,430
Tell him to get here as soon as he can.

66
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:21,665
Your Grace, you can't stay.

67
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,867
If the English see you on horseback,

68
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,702
if they even recognize you as a noble,

69
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,203
they'll take you out first.

70
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,408
Meet your new commander.

71
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:34,944
We're advancing to a bloody castle.

72
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:40,383
<i>GREER: We missed you at breakfast.</i>

73
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:42,218
It's not healthy to
spend so much time alone.

74
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:43,419
I know, I'm sorry.

75
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:44,953
I'm just worried about Francis.

76
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:47,022
I know you parted on painful terms.

77
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:48,924
He took men meant for
my mother's protection

78
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,194
to save French soldiers.

79
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:53,596
I know he had to.

80
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,364
Thousands of Frenchmen
would have died otherwise.

81
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,068
Do all married couples
have these struggles?

82
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:01,369
I think you've redefined marital discord.

83
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:03,005
(laughs)

84
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:12,447
Mary, what is it?

85
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,148
That guard.

86
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:16,951
Every time I see him, I
want to gouge his eyes out.

87
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,421
Why on earth? Who is he?

88
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:21,823
Your Grace, pardon my intrusion,

89
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:23,592
but there's an urgent letter for you.

90
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:25,594
Ah, my cousins!

91
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,428
(laughs)

92
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:30,732
Roman, how lovely to see you.

93
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,734
Ah.

94
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:34,001
Hortensa.

95
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,937
You look well, Catherine.

96
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,238
Given the circumstances.

97
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:39,273
What circumstances are those?

98
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,809
That your husband has
left the castle again.

99
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:44,411
I hear he's with a mistress in Paris.

100
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:46,380
Usually you time your visits

101
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:48,482
around Henry's availability.

102
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:52,453
Though it could be said
he's in a bad temper of late.

103
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:55,989
So you would have enjoyed
his company less than usual.

104
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:57,858
I always enjoy his company.

105
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:00,160
As I know he always greatly enjoyed mine.

106
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:01,862
Except for the day when
he left you in tears

107
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:03,630
because he decided to marry me.

108
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:06,566
Oh, life is full of surprises, isn't it?

109
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:07,667
Roman has trade.

110
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,469
As for me,

111
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:11,471
I've come to reclaim the
team of men I loaned you.

112
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:13,673
I need them for a job back in Florence.

113
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,408
I assume you have no objection

114
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:16,643
as they've already served their purpose?

115
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,644
Mary.

116
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,211
These are my cousins.

117
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,514
Hortensa, Roman de Medici.

118
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,048
Mary, Queen of Scotland.

119
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:25,485
I remember you as a child.

120
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,488
So talkative, free with words.

121
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,523
Catherine, could I have
a private word with you?

122
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,891
Oh, there you go.

123
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,092
More words.

124
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,394
Of course.

125
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:36,662
Uh, Beatrice, will you please

126
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,230
show my cousins to their chambers

127
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:39,298
and stay with them

128
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,434
to ensure their comfort?

129
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,469
Mary, what is it?

130
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:45,905
MARY: I've received a
letter from my mother.

131
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,339
Marie de Guise.

132
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,041
The Protestant insurgents
surrounding her castle

133
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,375
are demanding blood.

134
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:52,177
It's no longer a case of fighting them.

135
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:53,712
If she has any hope of survival,

136
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,980
she needs to escape in secret.

137
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:57,816
But she needs money to do so.

138
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,485
For guards, transport, bribes if necessary.

139
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:01,920
(sighs)

140
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:03,422
Well, this is awful.

141
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,889
But why are you coming to me?

142
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:06,424
- You know that I can't...
- She also wrote to me

143
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,326
of a time when you feared for your life.

144
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:09,861
You wrote to my mother asking for help.

145
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:11,362
And she came through

146
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,431
with a loan of 50,000 crowns

147
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:16,234
- to recruit an army.
- I never used that money.

148
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:18,669
- Well, you never gave it back, either.
- I've exchanged

149
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:21,105
ten times that amount with your mother.

150
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:23,574
Is this really about an old debt?

151
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:25,776
No. It's about how it feels

152
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:28,713
to be a female ruler, trapped and alone.

153
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,615
If anyone knows how
terrifying that is, it is you.

154
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,850
And I'd help if I could.

155
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:34,452
But all of the court's money

156
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,587
is tied up in the war with Calais.

157
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,089
I'm not talking about the court's money.

158
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,623
I'm talking about your money.

159
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,525
The funds you keep hidden.

160
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,361
Just in case you have to
leave France in a hurry.

161
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,896
- I don't...
- Don't try to deny it.

162
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,530
Not six months ago,

163
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,632
you escaped the tower and
were ready to disappear

164
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,201
because Henry wanted you dead.

165
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:54,437
How were you going to
support yourself in exile?

166
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,439
You and my mother were friends once.

167
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,408
I wish her well.

168
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,877
There is no hidden money.

169
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:02,412
Catherine, I beg of you!

170
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,947
You're a queen! Don't beg.

171
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:08,117
It invites sympathy, then pity,

172
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,920
then disdain.

173
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,056
Give the impression that you're weak,

174
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,692
and you'll soon need a secret fund.

175
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:25,167
(creaking nearby)

176
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:26,936
That's all. You may go.

177
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:40,749
Who's there?

178
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,183
John Priveaux.

179
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,752
At your service.

180
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:45,420
I wondered when you'd get here.

181
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:46,587
You weren't seen?

182
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:47,622
I'm never seen.

183
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,791
And yet your name is
known in certain circles.

184
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:52,093
Your uncle's for one?

185
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,296
He has spoken of your rise in your field.

186
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,797
A man who gets the job done.

187
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:56,798
A mercenary.

188
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:57,933
Your messenger said you had

189
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,534
an urgent matter to discuss.

190
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,937
Queen Catherine has a secret stash

191
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:05,306
of gold somewhere for emergencies.

192
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,575
I need you to find it and bring it to me.

193
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,310
I would have preferred to
have not used your services,

194
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:12,012
but I gave Catherine the option

195
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,581
of being a human being

196
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,183
and saving a life, and she refused.

197
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,118
Was that wise?

198
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,120
Considering you're about to steal it?

199
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,222
Done right, she won't
even notice it's gone.

200
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,723
Perhaps not for months.

201
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,192
By then, it will be too late.

202
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,393
Fair enough.

203
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,495
I'll have it for you in two days.

204
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:29,729
Well, how will you go about it?

205
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,332
You don't want the details.

206
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,899
I won't have blood spilled

207
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:34,468
if that's what you're intending.

208
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:36,536
No one intends to spill blood.

209
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:38,004
But plans go awry.

210
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:39,973
Obstacles come up.

211
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,875
I can't be expected to finish my job

212
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:44,010
with half my tools.

213
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:45,244
No innocent blood then.

214
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:46,913
Promise me.

215
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,483
I can promise I'll try.

216
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,085
But if it gets in the way of success...

217
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:55,588
You will keep me apprised before
any serious action is taken.

218
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,923
Leave everything to me.

219
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:11,670
Forgive me, Father.

220
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:13,572
Since my last confession,

221
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,675
I have taken the Lord's
name in vain many times.

222
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,378
And ordered the assassination
of a dozen Scottish visitors.

223
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:23,048
I struck my servant.

224
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,350
A slap, which I regret,

225
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,085
as it was a loss of self-control.

226
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,021
And she's been sulky ever since.

227
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:33,758
Also, my cousin Hortensa is here.

228
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,260
Expect worse of me.

229
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,762
I loathe her.

230
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:40,298
I'm prepared for my penance.

231
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,703
(thumping nearby)

232
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:48,105
Father?

233
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:50,642
(gasps)

234
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,379

242
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:29,754
Oh, come, Bash, the air
is bracing, we're all young

243
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:32,123
and wed, and you must
shake this black mood.

244
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:33,791
There's nothing that you can do.

245
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,593
That's exactly the problem, isn't it?

246
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,662
I'm here while thousands
bleed from English swords.

247
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:38,729
And my brother...

248
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:40,298
Francis will survive the war.

249
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:41,399
You must believe that.

250
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:42,900
It's true, Bash.

251
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:45,403
There's no point in
imagining anything else.

252
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,272
Come play.

253
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:52,442
(grunts)

254
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,677
(laughs)

255
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:58,415
Is that as good as you've got?

256
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,983
(laughs)

257
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,888
(speaks indistinctly)

258
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,226
(laughs)

259
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,261
(groans)

260
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:13,129
Lola!

261
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,166
Are you all right?

262
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,401
It's just a cramp.

263
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,869
Uh, they've been happening.

264
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:22,571
But this one... uh,
perhaps I should lie down.

265
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:25,507
We need to take care of you.

266
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,947
FRANCIS: We'll stop and rest here.

267
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,815
GASTON: How much further
to the English line, sir?

268
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,617
FRANCIS: Just a few miles.

269
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,387
(twigs snapping)

270
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,623

00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,130
(grunting)

272
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,949
Aah!

273
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,988
(grunts)

274
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:23,698
(man roaring)

275
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,125
What is your name?

276
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,527
Leith Bayard, sir.

277
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,030
I am in your debt, Leith Bayard.

278
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,336
I told him you were a good luck charm.

279
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,438
Who'd kill the Dauphin of France?

280
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,941
We were safe with you.

281
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,577
I'm not a good luck charm.

282
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,281
GASTON: No.

283
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,720
(rattling)

284
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,223
(panting)

285
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,595
I know you're there.

286
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,032
Oh, you're wise

287
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,900
not to speak, though it tells me more

288
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,636
than you think.

289
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,671
For one thing,

290
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,573
this has nothing to do with the war.

291
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,075
If it did, our negotiations

292
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:26,844
would be much more in the open.

293
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,913
You'd be boasting about
your English superiority.

294
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:30,881
(breathing hard)

295
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,650
And for another, it tells me

296
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,151
that you don't intend to kill me...

297
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:38,021
at least not yet.

298
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:39,389
Which means you want something.

299
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,925
Information, perhaps?

300
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:45,095
Money?

301
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,197
And since you got into
the castle so easily,

302
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,567
you either work there... unlikely...

303
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,234
or you're a mercenary,

304
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,705
hired to kidnap me for someone else.

305
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,908
Someone close to me,

306
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:02,545
in desperate need of funds,

307
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,848
who has long had it in for me.

308
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:06,082
(laughs breathlessly)

309
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:08,484
A young queen, perhaps?

310
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:13,922
The good news is,

311
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,924
you've chosen your victim wisely.

312
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:20,963
I'll double whatever they offered.

313
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:24,299
But you must bring me the head

314
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,902
of the person responsible for this.

315
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:30,772
Do we have a deal?

316
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,041
(floorboards creaking)

317
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:45,453
Oh, there you go, that's a nice kick.

318
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:46,921
The baby's well.

319
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,156
You'll be fine, too.

320
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,590
Bit of blood isn't anything

321
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,626
as long as it stops, and yours did.

322
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:52,894
Rest here a bit.

323
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,662
Thank you, Agnes.

324
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:02,503
Would you like more water?

325
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:04,471
Another pillow?

326
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:06,607
I think all I need is rest.

327
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:08,275
It's getting harder as the weeks go by.

328
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,578
You're sharing a bed with two of us,

329
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:11,979
one who steals the covers

330
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,514
and the other one kicks
and turns all night.

331
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:15,516
(laughs)

332
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,584
Perhaps I should sleep in
my quarters this evening.

333
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:20,354
That's not what I want. Not at all.

334
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,592
You've been so kind to me.

335
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:28,529
A better husband than
I could have hoped for.

336
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:29,796
Or might deserve.

337
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,031
Don't do that.

338
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:33,499
All I meant was, I've been happy.

339
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,936
Really and truly happy these last months.

340
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,204
When I think of how things
might have gone for me...

341
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:40,306
I'd be facing moments like this alone,

342
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,609
save for some cold nuns around me,

343
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:44,110
judging me.

344
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,845
I'm glad I'm a step up from a nunnery.

345
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,549
I am a bit scared about giving birth.

346
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,451
I know you fear it as well.

347
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:53,286
It's dangerous for women.

348
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,520
Lola...

349
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:55,721
Would you be with me?

350
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:57,823
At my side?

351
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:00,993
I... I think you'll be in better hands

352
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,228
with your lady friends.

353
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:04,563
<i>I want to hold your hand.</i>

354
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,331
You make me feel safe.

355
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,068
- I need...
- You don't.

356
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,671
I always want to be there for you.

357
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:14,673
That's not the same

358
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,075
as saying you'll be with me.

359
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,743
I, uh...

360
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:19,877
It's all right, I understand.

361
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,147
It's not common for men
to witness childbirth...

362
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,415
It's not that.

363
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,683
If I'm careful with my words,

364
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,253
it's only so you'll understand.

365
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,189
You have a strength
you have yet to realize.

366
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:33,391
Remember that.

367
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,494
Always.

368
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,564
What do you mean, the
queen has been kidnapped?

369
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,500
I would keep your voice down,

370
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:45,202
unless you're trying to
alert the entire country

371
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,771
to the vulnerability of Henry's court.

372
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,406
Someone slipped this note

373
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:50,842
under my chamber door

374
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,209
ten minutes ago.

375
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,712
"20,000 francs to be delivered to the base

376
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,449
of the Louis XI obelisk
by sundown tomorrow."

377
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,017
Good Lord.

378
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,685
As you're the last royal in the castle,

379
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,587
I thought it prudent to let you know.

380
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,557
In case you want to do anything about it.

381
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,025
What do you mean?

382
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,259
The Medici family

383
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:10,593
has a long-standing tradition

384
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,929
not to negotiate with kidnappers.

385
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:15,198
If we bowed to their demands,

386
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:17,134
we would never be safe.

387
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:20,103
- Well, what of Catherine?
- Well, perhaps Henry will pay the ransom.

388
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:21,371
It will take days

389
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,839
to get word to him in Paris,

390
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,708
long after the deadline.

391
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,409
The letter makes it clear

392
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:28,545
that if we do not give into the demands,

393
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,913
Catherine's body will be
dumped at the castle gates.

394
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:32,248
My dear,

395
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:34,217
I've been in this situation before,

396
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,652
and there are really only

397
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,253
two possible outcomes.

398
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,921
Either Catherine's kidnappers

399
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:40,323
intend to return her alive...

400
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:42,324
in which case, they'll certainly

401
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,993
wait a few days for the ransom...

402
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:46,062
or they don't.

403
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,631
In which case, there's
really no rush to do anything.

404
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,366
(door opens)

405
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,263
A servant just dropped this off at my door.

406
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,965
She said it was found at the castle gate.

407
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,771
(gasps) My God.

408
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:04,105
That earring...

409
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,374
it's Catherine's.

410
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,975
(sighs)

411
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,044
Then there is a third possible outcome.

412
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,214
The kidnappers intend to
return Catherine alive,

413
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,715
but in pieces.

414
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,750
Our policy is clear.

415
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:19,854
We simply can't give in to their demands.

416
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:27,550
The castle of Montmorency lies before us,

417
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,815
- ours for the taking.
- What makes you so sure we'll take it?

418
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:31,465
Did you see the men who
attacked us this morning?

419
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,734
I was too busy soiling
my pants, Your Grace.

420
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,066
There was a man with a red beard

421
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,601
and another wearing a lady's favor.

422
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,136
I saw them before, twice.

423
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:40,205
Don't you see?

424
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,940
The castle is undermanned.

425
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:45,410
The same few men are being sent each time.

426
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:47,879
They strike fast and withdraw
to deceive us into thinking

427
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:49,280
that the castle is too strong to take.

428
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,115
<i>Soon it will be too strong.</i>

429
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,449
We must get there before

430
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:53,450
the English reinforcements arrive.

431
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,485
Wait.

432
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,387
Get in position! Move!

433
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:57,722
Take cover!

434
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:04,128
We can't fight that, Your Grace!

435
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,862
We can't even turn and run. What now?

436
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,529
We have no choice.

437
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:11,902
We stay and finish this, or we die trying.

438
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,993
Kenna told me that you were unwell,

439
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,227
that it might be the baby.

440
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,996
We're both fine, thank you.

441
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,100
You don't look fine.

442
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:27,003
What is it?

443
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:29,672
I received word from my family's banker.

444
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:32,007
The dowry was transferred
to my husband two days ago.

445
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,241
The money Julien

446
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:34,677
has been waiting for has arrived

447
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:35,911
and is in his grasp.

448
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,713
I thought you were holding it back.

449
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:39,848
No, the banker couldn't, not anymore.

450
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,284
Legally, he's owed it.

451
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,952
And worse still, the banker said

452
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:45,386
Julien had been pressing for it.

453
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:47,055
That he'd been relentless.

454
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:49,590
But you have no proof he
needs the money, do you?

455
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:50,959
No.

456
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:52,928
But Julien married me

457
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:55,230
before he loved me, or I loved him.

458
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,464
And I do love him...

459
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:58,566
But...

460
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,568
why would he, why would any man,

461
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:02,470
marry a girl pregnant
with another man's child

462
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:04,539
unless he was going to
get something out of it?

463
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,106
And what if he did?

464
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:08,509
What if he's secretly broke

465
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:10,010
and ashamed, or in debt.

466
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:11,245
And he met and married

467
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:12,880
a very rich girl

468
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:14,114
who only married him because she's pregnant

469
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:15,950
with another man's child.

470
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,617
And what if those two people

471
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,587
fell in love anyway?

472
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,522
If the end of your story is a happy one,

473
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,359
then does how it began really matter?

474
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:31,598
I hope Lord Castleroy is your happy ending.

475
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:34,868
Do you think of Leith often?

476
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,537
Every day.

477
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:39,305
I pray for his future,

478
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,775
I pray for his survival...

479
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:44,244
even though I'll never
set eyes on him again.

480
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,181
(distant shouting)

481
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:50,283
ENGLISH SOLDIER: Fire!

482
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:54,787
The English have placed
a wagon full of gunpowder

483
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:56,022
next to the cannon,

484
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,790
for ease of reloading.

485
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,626
One flaming arrow,
well-aimed, would take it out,

486
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,861
as well as the entire English squad.

487
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,363
You won't make it ten feet out of

488
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,931
these trees before you're blown to pieces.

489
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:06,932
If I acted alone, yes, but
not if we work together.

490
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,501
That cannon can only shoot

491
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,269
in one direction at a time.

492
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:12,137
If you were to charge down the right flank,

493
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,706
drawing its fire,

494
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:15,307
I could sneak down the
left and get close enough

495
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,642
to take the shot.

496
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,044
(murmuring)

497
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:22,114
- Calais...
- They don't care about Calais.

498
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,219
They know how lords and
generals talk of battle.

499
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,187
The men are chess pieces.

500
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:30,989
But we don't see ourselves that way.

501
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,224
No one risks their life

502
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,358
for some lord's strategy.

503
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:36,194
We do it for those we love,

504
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:38,964
for our brothers-in-arms,

505
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:40,532
and so we don't look like cowards.

506
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,833
And for money.

507
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,067
(soldier chuckles)

508
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:45,537
I don't view you as chess pieces.

509
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,539
Then prove it.

510
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:49,073
Get us out of here alive.

511
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,675
I can't promise that.

512
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:51,976
But this is not a lord's strategy.

513
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,244
This is about survival.

514
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:55,379
That cannon is the fist of God.

515
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:58,582
If we stay here and do nothing,
it will pound us to pieces.

516
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,218
But if we advance,

517
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:03,254
dispersed and on the move,

518
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,556
the English won't know who to target.

519
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,525
It is the best chance
for most of us to survive.

520
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:15,532
Greer told Lola not to worry
about Julien, but I worry.

521
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,335
All I'm asking is that
you get close to him,

522
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:20,003
feel him out on his finances.

523
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,438
- No.
- His background?

524
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:23,540
- No.
- Well, why not?

525
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,442
You don't want to pick this marriage apart.

526
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:29,245
It came together very quickly.

527
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,414
Let them find their way.

528
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:34,217
You know.

529
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,354
That Lola got pregnant by someone else.

530
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:39,022
That's why she rushed to the altar.

531
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:41,224
Do you know by who?

532
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,558
No.

533
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,760
But I suspect you do.

534
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:48,598
Some cad who can't take responsibility.

535
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,600
But she found Julien.

536
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:52,368
And maybe she's lucky.

537
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,804
Her child will have a
name, respectability...

538
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:56,071
She's in love with him.

539
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:59,008
And if he's not in love with her...

540
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:00,877
She can never be free of him.

541
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:01,944
They're wed.

542
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:03,645
She can protect her heart.

543
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,082
And as her friend, I
want to help her do that.

544
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,284
As my husband,

545
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,553
I want you to help me.

546
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:14,390
Please?

547
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,628
(footsteps approaching)

548
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:22,764
You said you would keep me apprised

549
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,298
before any serious action was taken.

550
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:25,800
I've spilled no blood.

551
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:27,802
You kidnapped the queen of France!

552
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,437
And cut off her ear.

553
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:31,105
You really are new at this, aren't you?

554
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:33,374
The queen is fine.

555
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,343
I purchased the ear off a grave-digger.

556
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:39,113
And put Catherine's earring
on it to better tell the tale.

557
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,614
Besides,

558
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:41,916
your orders were to get the money

559
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:42,983
as quickly as possible.

560
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,152
By stealing it.

561
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:45,520
Not by ransoming her.

562
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:46,787
The Medicis are refusing to pay.

563
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,256
I could have warned you about that.

564
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:49,690
The ransom is a distraction.

565
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,259
What anyone would expect in a kidnapping.

566
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,326
And is it your intention to kill the queen?

567
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:55,595
Since she surely suspects I'm responsible.

568
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:57,329
Oh, she suspects all right.

569
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:59,566
She's offered me double my
fee to bring her your head.

570
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:02,936
Relax, Mary.

571
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:05,408
(laughs) I wouldn't
succeed in my line of work

572
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:07,476
if it were known that I
could be turned so easily.

573
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:10,146
I'm not going to kill Catherine.

574
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,813
And you won't be blamed for this.

575
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,749
How do you intend to pull that off?

576
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,751
The queen has no way of
proving you're responsible.

577
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:18,921
So all we need is a credible alternative.

578
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:21,290
Someone we can frame for the crime.

579
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:23,625
I'll deliver the queen the head.

580
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,327
She'll pay me, and I'll give you the money.

581
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:26,929
Minus my cut.

582
00:23:26,963 --> 00:23:28,997
The queen goes free, and everyone's happy.

583
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,934
Except for the innocent
soul who dies in my stead.

584
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:33,334
If you're worried about innocence,

585
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,136
then choose someone who isn't.

586
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,138
Given all the treachery
and backstabbing at court,

587
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:39,608
it shouldn't be that hard. Pick a name.

588
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:41,877
Someone this world would
be better off without.

589
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:44,446
And don't waste time about it.

590
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,690
You hired a mercenary

591
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,158
to kidnap Catherine?

592
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:57,428
I didn't mean for it
to go that far, but yes.

593
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:59,997
Now, to get out of it, I have
to pin the crime on someone else.

594
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,266
You'd do that? You'd send
an innocent to their death?

595
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:04,469
I don't know what I'm capable
of anymore, to be frank.

596
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:07,104
But there is one possibility.

597
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:09,506
For months I've been trying to figure out

598
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,874
which of Catherine's men participated

599
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,677
in the massacre of my
countrymen at the brothel.

600
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:16,446
Some time ago, I paid a servant

601
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,816
to track down one of the
prostitutes who escaped

602
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,551
to find some descriptions
of the men involved.

603
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,719
According to the prostitute,

604
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,053
one of the men had a scar

605
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,356
on his left cheek from brow to chin.

606
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,690
Lots of men have scars.

607
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,892
He also badly burned his
hands after the massacre.

608
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,027
This isn't justice.

609
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:32,028
It's solving your problems

610
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:33,029
with the blood of another.

611
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:34,231
I know how this goes.

612
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,299
As do you.

613
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,901
That's why you came to me.

614
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:42,371
You killed someone in the woods

615
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:46,308
when the pagans forced
you to choose a sacrifice.

616
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,377
I did it for you.

617
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,580
And for myself.

618
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,183
I murdered a man who was
about to kill another.

619
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:56,385
And to this day I wonder.

620
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:58,287
Did he have a family?

621
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:00,189
Did he die for his own beliefs?

622
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:02,591
Or was he simply acting on
the orders of those above him?

623
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,628
Was he really as guilty
as I thought at the time?

624
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:06,862
And what's the answer?

625
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,730
The answer is, you have to be sure.

626
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:11,433
Because if there's any doubt in your mind,

627
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,969
your conscience won't
ever let you rest again.

628
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:29,717
(indistinct whispering)

629
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:35,583
Mary.

630
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,819
What a talent you have
for sneaking up on people.

631
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,321
Oh, I couldn't help but notice you speaking

632
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:41,489
with Catherine's guard.

633
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:42,790
You mean my guard.

634
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:46,827
I lent Catherine my men some time ago.

635
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,328
Why do you ask?

636
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,430
I, um, wanted to employ him

637
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:51,932
to help me find Catherine.

638
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,834
(laughs) My dear.

639
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:55,335
You need to be a much better liar

640
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,504
if you want anyone to take you seriously.

641
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:59,373
I wanted to question him.

642
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,341
He did some work for Catherine.

643
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,377
And I'm curious to the specifics.

644
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:04,678
The whorehouse massacre.

645
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:07,981
Don't act so surprised.

646
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:09,783
My guards may have served Catherine,

647
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:12,286
but they're loyal to me.

648
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:15,689
Did she put you up to this?

649
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:17,457
Who? Catherine?

650
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,892
She's been trying to banish me

651
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,059
from court for years.

652
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:22,461
Afraid I'll steal her husband.

653
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:25,865
She already assigned that
little harlot of hers,

654
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,333
Beatrice, to spy on me.

655
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:28,734
And now she's got you doing it, too.

656
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:32,071
You're trying to gauge my involvement

657
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,207
in the slaughter of your countrymen.

658
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:36,709
Well, I had nothing to do with it.

659
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:38,844
I loaned Catherine those men

660
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:41,480
long before she planned the incident.

661
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:43,316
And if you intend to say otherwise,

662
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,584
I'll deal with you in
the same way as Beatrice.

663
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:47,720
Queen or not.

664
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:49,422
Are you threatening me?

665
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:52,157
Let's just say I can't have either of you

666
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,591
bearing false witness to Henry

667
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:54,827
when he returns.

668
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:55,828
If it means

669
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,595
stepping on an insect,

670
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,564
a servant, a nothing

671
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:01,566
to make my point clear,

672
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:04,769
I don't mind getting the
heel of my shoe bloody.

673
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:06,939
If I've read you wrong,

674
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:09,941
I apologize.

675
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:13,411
But Catherine must be taught

676
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:15,413
to stay out of my affairs.

677
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:18,683
Assuming she makes it back to the castle.

678
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:27,791
I was about to send the
servants to look for you.

679
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,293
Where have you been?

680
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:30,694
Looking into Julien's background.

681
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:31,963
Among other things.

682
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:33,865
Is he destitute? He was married before.

683
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,933
- Did he kill his wives?
- I have no idea.

684
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:38,035
But I did learn of his
activities closer to home.

685
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,104
He's planning a hunting trip.

686
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,406
- Lola mentioned it.
- With one horse

687
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,874
and a carriage to carry some belongings.

688
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:46,343
But no hounds, no falcons.

689
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:49,045
He didn't request hunting gear of any kind.

690
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:52,716
You said her dowry came through.

691
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:54,551
Yes. It's in his possession.

692
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,587
You think he's going to leave her?

693
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:57,988
I don't know.

694
00:27:58,022 --> 00:27:59,489
But he's leaving the castle tonight.

695
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:00,556
And I don't for a minute

696
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,759
think he's going hunting.

697
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,040
Did you do as I asked?

698
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:21,010
(gasps)

699
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:30,685
I don't believe it.

700
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:34,623
Did you cut off the head
of Mary, Queen of Scots?

701
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,292
No.

702
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,960
I brought the head of the one

703
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:39,895
behind your kidnapping.

704
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,163
As you asked.

705
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,364
What? Not Mary?

706
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,865
Then who?

707
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,001
Answer carefully.

708
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:48,136
If you lie,

709
00:28:48,203 --> 00:28:50,371
I won't tell you where to find the money.

710
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,340
Someone who's hated you for a long time.

711
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:55,343
Who needed money desperately.

712
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:57,011
You'll find proof of what I've said

713
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,313
when you return to the castle.

714
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:01,015
Now, where's the gold?

715
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,384
(grunts)

716
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,821
If you lie, I'll find you again.

717
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:09,090
And next time I'll take
your children as well.

718
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:11,859
There's a chest of gold

719
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,861
in an empty sarcophagus,

720
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:16,797
beneath the apse of the
Church of St. Isabelle.

721
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,820
Hortensa.

722
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,595
Be fast.

723
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:51,529
Don't miss.

724
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:56,300
(all yelling)

725
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,702
Sir, they're advancing!

726
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:23,126
God save us all.

727
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:38,440
(all cheering, whooping)

728
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:45,848
(laughter)

729
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:47,683
Well done, men! All of you!

730
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:50,152
Where's Leith?

731
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:53,054
He was behind me.

732
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:54,323
Leith!

733
00:30:57,285 --> 00:30:59,653
A carriage but no hounds
for a hunting trip?

734
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:00,721
Isn't that odd?

735
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:02,022
Bash found his lack of interest

736
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:03,857
in hunting supplies quite odd, yes.

737
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:05,659
Oh, he's going to leave me.

738
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:07,728
If you love Julien, you should talk to him.

739
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:09,062
See if he will share his troubles.

740
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,797
And pray that they're just financial.

741
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:13,033
(door opens)

742
00:31:13,101 --> 00:31:15,168
I was just checking in
on your beautiful bride.

743
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:17,237
LOLA: Thank you, Kenna.

744
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:23,376
Uh, no, darling, don't.

745
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:25,011
Please. I want to talk.

746
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:27,180
What you need is rest.

747
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:28,348
And I'm going to sleep in my quarters

748
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:29,349
this evening so you get it.

749
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,251
And the hunting trip?

750
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:32,885
Are you still going on it?

751
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,755
I may, yes, if you're well.

752
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:37,590
Don't.

753
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,291
Please don't.

754
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,559
Stay with me.

755
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:42,227
All right. Uh...

756
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,930
but I may stop in court
for a hand of cards. Hmm?

757
00:31:44,965 --> 00:31:47,199
I'll have your dinner sent to you.

758
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:50,036
Julien, please hear me.

759
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,438
I don't need elaborate things,

760
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:55,774
anything that you can't provide.

761
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:57,742
I admit I... I went into this marriage

762
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,943
as a means of survival.

763
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:00,479
But I never would have done that

764
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:01,946
if I hadn't thought I'd found someone

765
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:03,715
I could care for.

766
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:06,151
And I do.

767
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:07,752
I want you.

768
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:10,622
And you can keep me for much less

769
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,424
than you might imagine.

770
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,926
I wish you could believe that.

771
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,431
Who could believe that of a girl like you?

772
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:25,403
You're everything I ever dreamed of.

773
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,748
Get back!

774
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:39,317
I want every entrance
to the castle locked down

775
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,784
till further notice.

776
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,986
- Catherine. Thank God.
- CATHERINE: You.

777
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:44,788
You expect me to believe

778
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:47,290
you know nothing of this?

779
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:49,459
No, I swear.

780
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:51,028
Organize a search of Hortensa's rooms

781
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,495
and those of Mary, Queen of Scots.

782
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,331
I want to know everything about her:

783
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:56,100
her movements, her letters,
anyone she's been meeting with.

784
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,836
Until I'm satisfied with
the details of what happened,

785
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,938
I will seek the identity of my
true abductor and destroy them.

786
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:04,307
Go!

787
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:06,309
- (hawk screaming)
- FRANCIS: Leith!

788
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:08,144
Leith?

789
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:10,980
Over here!

790
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:13,015
(groaning)

791
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,884
He needs a physician.

792
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,386
The nearest French encampment
is a few miles away.

793
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,187
- We'll go get help.
- No, you must join the others.

794
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:20,289
We need as many men as
possible at the castle.

795
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:22,391
See that they send a
rider to the Duke of Guise,

796
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:23,492
telling him that the way is open,

797
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:25,228
but it may not be for long.

798
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:27,163
Hurry... the war is all but
won if we press our advantage.

799
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,831
You should go as well.

800
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,699
- I'll be all right.
- Shut up.

801
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:32,835
You'll bleed out in the
field as our army passes by.

802
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,236
I am not about to let you die.

803
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:35,837
You're coming with me.

804
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:38,474
Oh, please. No, I can't...

805
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:40,842
(groans) I can't make it.

806
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:42,177
Please. Please.

807
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:47,215
A wise man once told me...

808
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,651
yesterday, as a matter of fact...

809
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:50,051
that we fight for those that we love.

810
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:51,686
I'm just like you.

811
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,389
I want to go home.

812
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:56,124
There must be someone that
you'll fight to see again.

813
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:01,729
There's a woman.

814
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:02,998
But it could never work.

815
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:04,365
- Is she married?
- No.

816
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,901
(coughs)

817
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:07,368
Not yet, anyway.

818
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:10,004
But she's above my station.

819
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:11,572
Well, have you considered

820
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,508
that maybe you have more to offer her now?

821
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:15,310
The friendship of the next king of France.

822
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:16,744
Do you know what kings get to do?

823
00:34:16,812 --> 00:34:18,245
They get to give lands and titles

824
00:34:18,314 --> 00:34:20,214
to those they wish to reward.

825
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:22,116
It's one of the better
aspects of being king,

826
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,051
because, trust me, some of
them are far less enjoyable.

827
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:25,820
You'd do that?

828
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:27,154
For me?

829
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:28,789
Why wouldn't I?

830
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:31,058
Because you're merely a chess piece?

831
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:33,727
I have lost good men,

832
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:35,662
and I'm not prepared to sacrifice any more,

833
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:37,131
especially if I can help it.

834
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:39,633
Live, Leith Bayard. Live...

835
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,935
and go home to the woman you love.

836
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:44,404
Marry her and be happy

837
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:46,039
and live for as long as you possibly can.

838
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:47,374
<i>But live.</i>

839
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:55,349
(groans)

840

(trumpet fanfare)

841
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:06,625
FRANCIS: It's our men.

842
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,328
The road to Calais is now open.

(door opens)

857
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,478
Roman De Medici, Your Grace.

858
00:35:52,513 --> 00:35:54,580
(sighs)

859
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,952
I supervised the search of Hortensa's room.

860
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:02,188
Her jewel box was empty.

861
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:04,290
Turns out she was penniless.

862
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:05,991
How?

863
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:07,826
I thought her husband left
her a fortune when he died.

864
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:11,129
- We found this among her things.
- Bring it.

865
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:21,013
Instructions on the delivery of money?

866
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:22,781
It would seem she was being blackmailed.

867
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,517
By someone who suspected

868
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:25,951
she had arranged her husband's death.

869
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:27,319
(exhales) And did she?

870
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,686
You know Hortensa.

871
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:30,122
It's distinctly possible.

872
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,823
According to that letter,

873
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,258
she had been paying vast sums

874
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,460
for years to keep the secret.

875
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:36,961
That's why she came here

876
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:38,296
and held you for ransom.

877
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,034
I'm sorry, Catherine.

878
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,803
I don't know how any of
this escaped our notice.

879
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,439
For a moment, what I
thought had escaped my notice

880
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,441
was Mary, Queen of Scots.

881
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,643
(sighs)

882
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,012
A child I'd raised for a while.

883
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,814
I wondered what lessons
she'd learned from me lately.

884
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:58,683
I warned her not to beg,

885
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,484
not to look weak.

886
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,686
You think she arranged all this?

887
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,124
I think she's capable of all of it,

888
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,160
except the murder of Hortensa.

889
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:14,731
It takes time for a
woman to grow that hard.

890
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,802
I was nearly 30

891
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,902
when I killed an innocent.

892
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,006
I suppose innocence is all relative.

893
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,711
I wonder how long Mary's will last.

894
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,681
Because once gone, it
can never be reclaimed.

895
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:36,586
- LOLA: Julien.
- I didn't play cards.

896
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:37,978
I was going to leave you,

897
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:39,712
and I suspect you knew that.

898
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:42,815
I've fallen out with my family.

899
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:44,284
They're not good people.

900
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:45,585
I... I don't want to go into it

901
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:47,587
beyond that. I only...

902
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:50,890
I have no money of my own.

903
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:54,126
I was going to live off yours.

904
00:37:54,194 --> 00:37:56,896
What I could get my hands on, anyway.

905
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:58,898
Your dowry.

906
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:00,132
Go on.

907
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,003
I am about as close to penniless

908
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:07,239
as a son of a wealthy family could ever be.

909
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:09,441
And is that why you married me?

910
00:38:09,476 --> 00:38:12,411
Why you didn't care about me
carrying another man's child?

911
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,812
Because of my money?

912
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:15,680
Yes.

913
00:38:16,682 --> 00:38:19,684
But as I came to love you,

914
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:22,453
I knew I couldn't keep such
a secret from you any longer.

915
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:25,089
The shame of telling you the truth,

916
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:27,158
of admitting that our
life could only be funded

917
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:28,760
by your family's money...

918
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:30,161
What about my shame?

919
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:32,597
Abandoned not one year into our marriage.

920
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:33,965
Did you think about that?

921
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,167
I wasn't thinking clearly.

922
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:39,470
You said you didn't want to be alone,

923
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:43,474
that fear made you want me at your side.

924
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,444
Well, my fear made me want to run away.

925
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:47,945
What are you so afraid of?

926
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:51,282
All I have to offer you...

927
00:38:51,316 --> 00:38:52,883
is me.

928
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:56,620
But I thought if you meant what you said,

929
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:58,355
if you needed less,

930
00:38:58,389 --> 00:38:59,890
if you could live a simpler life...

931
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:01,725
I could.

932
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,794
I want to.

933
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:05,195
I want to forgive you,

934
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:07,197
I... I want to be with you,

935
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,232
but how do I trust you?

936
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:11,668
With time.

937
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:15,572
With our whole lives.

938
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,674
I will prove myself to you.

939
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:21,411
♪ It's all to come ♪

940
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,413

941
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,248
I promise.

942
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:30,920
♪ For now we're still young. ♪

943
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,193
You came back.

944
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:39,395
This is just a sample.

945
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:42,599
The rest is hidden safely,
awaiting your instructions.

946
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,067
Minus my cut, of course.

947
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:45,401
And Hortensa's body?

948
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:47,002
Buried safely,

949
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:49,572
with a forged letter
planted in her chambers

950
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:49,042
to convince Catherine of her guilt.

951
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:52,318
I took her head quickly,

952
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,953
if that brings you peace.

953
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:55,221
You made an excellent choice.

954
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,257
I'm not sure there is one
when it comes to murder.

955
00:39:57,324 --> 00:39:59,125
But I've been at court long enough

956
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,360
to know how the Medicis work,

957
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:01,727
and how they act.

958
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:03,629
Hortensa was going to have Beatrice killed.

959
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:05,998
Her guard confirmed it.

960
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:08,233
I traded one life for another today.

961
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:10,135
And I pray that I've saved my mother.

962
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,171
- But at what price?
- Count yourself lucky

963
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,940
it was bought so cheaply, Your Grace.

964
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,943
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

965
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,610
Actually,

966
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:21,680
I'm not quite done with your services yet,

967
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:23,282
if you're still willing.

968
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:24,783
That gold you acquired
is bound for Scotland,

969
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,418
to help my mother.

970
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:29,088
I need to be sure it
arrives in the right hands.

971
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,689
I need someone I can trust

972
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:32,991
to lead a group of men
to secure her rescue.

973
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,225
There would be a substantial purse

974
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:35,660
in it for you, as well, of course.

975
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:37,862
Finding men like myself,

976
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,263
willing to do whatever's necessary

977
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:41,232
in spite of the risks, isn't easy.

978
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,568
I've already taken care of that part.

979
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:45,770
Follow me.

980
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:50,541
(men conversing indistinctly)

981
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:54,512
These men used to work for Hortensa,

982
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,114
until their mistress lost her head,

983
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:57,548
and now they work for me.

984
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:01,919
And they answer to you.

985
00:41:01,987 --> 00:41:03,187
Pack your belongings.

986
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,755
Be ready to sail within the hour.

987
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:07,224
Yes, Your Grace.

988
00:41:09,995 --> 00:41:11,228
JOHN: Are you sure

989
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:13,063
you know what you're doing?

990
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,965
Those men are rumored to have carried out

991
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,466
the massacre of your countrymen.

992
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:18,468
They're monsters.

993
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:21,739
Indeed they are... but
they're my monsters now.
