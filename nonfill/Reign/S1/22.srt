1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,859
<i>Previously on Reign...</i>

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,689
Have you seen him?
Have you seen the Darkness?

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,544
I was born a pagan.

4
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:08,495
Is that why you've taken this on?

5
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:11,350
Because you feel some blame
for the blood spilled by this faith?

6
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,392
(Trembling):
Leave me alone.

7
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:17,733
CATHERINE: <i>He is mad, and a mad king
incites chaos and rebellion.</i>

8
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,012
FRANCIS: <i>He listened to me.</i>

9
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:21,408
<i>His sanity started trickling
back in, and for a moment</i>

10
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,709
I could actually see my father again.

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,613
HENRY: <i>I must kill my son</i>
and wed his wife.

12
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,029
WOMAN: <i>What's happening?</i>

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,516
BOY:<i> I'm frightened.
I don't want to go!</i>

14
00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:37,055
GIRL: Is the king angry again?

15
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:39,812
What's going on?
Is the castle under attack?

16
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:41,793
The king has summoned
everyone to the courtyard.

17
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:43,162
Urgently.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,321
What's this about?

19
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:50,763
CATHERINE: I don't know,
but I fear the worst.

20
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:57,342
One or more of you here,
my friends, my family...

21
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:58,944
my subjects...

22
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:00,446
tried to kill me.

23
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:02,448
I have taken steps.

24
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:03,783
You have seen my new men,

25
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:07,120
modeled after the Praetorian Guard
of the Roman Emperors;

26
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,798
loyal only to me.

27
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,406
But I knew more needed to be done.

28
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:14,626
The guilty revealed.
And this night...

29
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:15,847
in a dream...

30
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:18,045
God told me how.

31
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:19,464
My oath to him...

32
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:21,466
This sword...

33
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:22,700
will not be sheathed

34
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:25,203
till it has taken a life.

35
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:28,106
As the sun rises,
this sword will cast a shadow.

36
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:30,074
When that shadow touches the guilty...

37
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:31,810
I'll know.

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,921
(panting)

39
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:47,464
Not now.

40
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:51,195
Give them time to tell their
sins and due penance.

41
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:55,926
Let their souls be wiped clean.
God likes that best.

42
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:58,959
Everyone wants to confess.

43
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,507
(rooster crowing)

44
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:06,076
Who here...

45
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:09,112
made their confession yesterday?

46
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:10,895
I did.

47
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,184
Travers, my lord.
Secretary to Lord Bellamy.

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,987
(Henry panting)

49
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:21,824
Did you fornicate last night?
Or take the Lord's name in vain?

50
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:23,993
Of course not, my lord.

51
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:26,429
We should all be as ready as you.

52
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,031
(women scream)

53
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,901
(grunting, gasping)

54
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,803
(choking)

55
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,971
(Henry panting)

56
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,374
Be off.

57
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,243
Don your finest clothing.

58
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,978
The celebrations of
our victory at Calais

59
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,513
will reach their peak.

60
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,549
Clean that.

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,887
I was wrong.

62
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,689
He is lost.

63
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:58,469

64
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:05,467
All the time I was growing up, I saw
him as the greatest man in France.

65
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,934
I'm sorry, Francis.

66
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,083
It's too late for assassination;
we'd never get near him.

67
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,110
(sighs)

68
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,511
He must be removed from the
throne by a superior force.

69
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,114
A coup?

70
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,717
It's deadly for us if we lose
and dangerous if we win.

71
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:24,319
A coup puts power in
the hands of the military.

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,853
We have no choice.

73
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:27,421
But how? What can I offer

74
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:29,022
the generals to back me,
rather than Father?

75
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:31,225
I can give them
no more reward than he.

76
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:35,563
Some generals were dismissed
before Calais.

77
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,131
Surely, they feel betrayed
by their king.

78
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:39,199
And each one of them is
a noble with a territory

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,268
and men of their own to command.

80
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,902
It could work.

81
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:44,805
But if we win,
if we seize power...

82
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:47,040
what happens to your father?

83
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,109
He will be imprisoned,

84
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,917
see the finest doctors, and in time
either he will regain his senses

85
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,790
or he will die a natural death, but...

86
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,448
he can never be king again.

87
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:57,818
His time will be over...

88
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,731
and you will rule beside me.

89
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,326
KENNA: <i>Pascal.</i>

90
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:07,627
<i>What is it, what's wrong?</i>

91
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,262
I've had a nightmare.

92
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:10,897
I saw him...

93
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,333
outside the window,
staring at us.

94
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,740
(man speaking indistinctly)

95
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:25,198
KENNA: You see? The guards
that Bash sent are here.

96
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:27,694
You're safe. It was just a dream.

97
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:33,285
<i>Bash will return</i>
<i>from Visegard soon.</i>

98
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:35,184
<i>And when he finds the Darkness,</i>

99
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:37,390
<i>we'll make sure</i>
<i>he never threatens you</i>

100
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,337
<i>or anyone else ever again.</i>

101
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:41,593
(indistinct chatter)

102
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,200
Your wounds have healed, I see.

103
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,635
Well, I found no more
excuses to stay in bed.

104
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:52,170
I also, um...

105
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,805
- I found this.
- Ah.

106
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:58,643
It's a deed to lands that include
farms, orchards, a manor house.

107
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:00,312
How could I ever thank you?

108
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:01,980
This is more than I could
have ever dreamed...

109
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,514
You saved my life.

110
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:04,920
I only regret that I couldn't
give you a title,

111
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,574
but that is the
king's job and my father is...

112
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,386
These are dark hours;

113
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,154
it is not a good time
to ask for such a thing.

114
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:11,823
We must share a drink.

115
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,290
I have something important to attend to.

116
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,025
Another time?

117
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,657
Oh, good luck with that girl
that you told me about.

118
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:19,929
If she doesn't wed you
now, she's a fool.

119
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:28,839
MONTGOMERY: I brought you that drink.
Don't you think you owe me a smile?

120
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,174
I didn't ask for the drink.

121
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:31,909
Feel free to take it back.

122
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,444
MONTGOMERY: You're making an enormous
mistake, you rich tart.

123
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:35,746
I am in the king's personal guard.

124
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,181
So you'd better start being nice to me,

125
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:39,215
- if you know what's best...
- Darling!

126
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:43,119
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.

127
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,721
This gentleman was just
keeping me amused.

128
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:45,722
Well...

129
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:49,125
Only the best for
the heroes of Calais...

130
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:51,495
Right?

131
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:55,965
Sorry for intruding.

132
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,733
I can tell when somebody's
being pushed into something

133
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:00,069
that they don't want to do;
I've seen too much of it.

134
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,737
In the army, you mean?

135
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:03,439
All my life.

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,508
Have a drink with me
and tell me about it.

137
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,545
I... I'd love to, but, uh...

138
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:11,514
I... truth is,
I'm-I'm looking for someone.

139
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:15,518
Those are the saddest words
I've heard all day.

140
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:22,926
Your Majesty,
I've done as you wished.

141
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,262
The matter of the
additional spice to be added

142
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:31,166
to the Dauphin's plate,
have you changed your mind?

143
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,235
No.

144
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:36,471
I want it done at tonight's feast.

145
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:41,743
Don't be concerned about the sin.

146
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:44,171
I reconciled with God for us both.

147
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:47,582
See his plate is piled high with meats.

148
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,216
To those watching,
it will look as though

149
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:50,518
Francis choked to death.

150
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:57,124
Oh! And tell them to
leave up the garlands.

151
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,726
I'm planning a wedding here...

152
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:00,356
in the near future. (sniffs)

153
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,747
<i>If</i> I can sway
the generals to my side,

154
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:10,050
I shall return with them
and their men beside me.

155
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:11,817
Will that be enough?

156
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,586
If the Duke of Guise
sets his forces against us...

157
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,120
He is a cautious man.

158
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:16,422
Perhaps he'll wait to
see who wins this...

159
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:17,890
Well!

160
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:20,387
Two happy couples on a happy day, hmm?

161
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:24,708
Mary, aren't you coming to see
the joust and the naval spectacle?

162
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,065
"Spectacle"?

163
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:30,105
Two ships in mock combat.
It will be a wonder.

164
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:32,104
And you... are the guest of honor.

165
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:32,957
Me?

166
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,709
Oh, Henry insists, my dear.

167
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,810
Oh, of course, I'm honored.

168
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:41,646
I regret we haven't been
as close as we should.

169
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:45,216
I may have been a bit judgmental
in your behavior with my sons

170
00:07:45,217 --> 00:07:47,752
and about your lack of
an heir with Francis.

171
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,455
As it turns out,
God's plan there may be...

172
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:53,190
for the best, after all.

173
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,760
- I should go.
- But, you can't.

174
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,797
You're not just a hero of Calais,
you led the invasion.

175
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:01,332
I am looking in at some
of the injured soldiers

176
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,616
who couldn't be here today.

177
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:05,566
But you will be back
for the feast... tonight?

178
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,871
- Of course.
- Hmm.

179
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:13,844
Shall we?

180
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,006
(door knocking)

181
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,488
Come in!

182
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,737
Could you put the tray
on the table over there?

183
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:26,212
I could,
but I don't have a tray.

184
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,859
- Should I go find one?
- Leith!

185
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,995
Thank God. I heard
you were alive, but...

186
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,397
What's this?

187
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,372
My land.

188
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,869
Look at the map.

189
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,267
Look at the list of holdings.
Farms, tenants paying rent!

190
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:43,573
River access, orchards,
a manor house.

191
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:47,176
- I don't understand.
- I'm a hero of Calais, Greer.

192
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,011
I saved the Dauphin's life.

193
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:52,054
Francis calls me his <i>friend.</i>

194
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:54,470
This is wonderful.

195
00:08:57,187 --> 00:09:01,257
But it...
It can't change anything.

196
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:02,892
I'm engaged to Lord Castleroy.

197
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:04,861
- I'm a rich man.
- You...

198
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:07,796
Are a comfortable man.

199
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,732
But this...

200
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,368
would not clear a tenth
of my father's debts.

201
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,370
It wouldn't provide
my sisters with dowries.

202
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,539
My father would sell them
to the highest bidder.

203
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,541
Well, they... well, they
could live with us!

204
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,077
You don't understand
how people like us live!

205
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,748
My sisters belong to my father,
they're his property!

206
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,416
He'd never agree
to let them move to...

207
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,752
what he'd see as some...

208
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,654
some backwater,

209
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,723
where they would never find
appropriate suitors.

210
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,458
I get the idea.

211
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,494
Please understand.

212
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,596
I'm... due in the harbor.

213
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,230
They want me to...

214
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:45,733
join some other veterans
on the ship; some kind of...

215
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,502
naval spectacle. (sighs)

216
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,506
Apparently, there are people who
consider today a celebration.

217
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,841
I don't want to part like this!

218
00:09:55,844 --> 00:10:00,180
Greer, at some point,
you have to stop piling

219
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:02,082
all of your family's
problems on your back.

220
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,418
You have to take a risk.

221
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:09,189
You have to trust love
and fate and me.

222
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:14,962
(door closes)

223
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,638
(knocking on door)

224
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:27,808
Uh, I beg your pardon, ma'am.

225
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,375
My carriage is in the road.

226
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,277
I'm taking a noblewoman
back to the castle,

227
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:32,878
and she has gone into labor.

228
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,213
Uh, my lady,

229
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:35,949
you should've waited for me to get you.

230
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,150
Hey, what are you doing?

231
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,351
I can't help you!

232
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,518
I'm not a midwife.

233
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,820
Then send for one.

234
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,621
I can reimburse you for your trouble.

235
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:45,491
What reimbursement will help me
if this lady dies on my hands?

236
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:47,961
Or her babe, and all
of France will blame me.

237
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:49,328
(groans)

238
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,729
(gasps)

239
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,130
(fanfare plays)

240
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:53,732
(crowd cheering)

241
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,301
ANNOUNCER: <i>His Majesty
King Henry of France.</i>

242
00:10:56,302 --> 00:11:00,372
<i>Her Majesty
Mary, Queen of Scots.</i>

243
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,576
<i>Her Majesty
Catherine, Queen of France.</i>

244
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,945
Turn your eyes on a
display of French might.

245
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,266
A spectacle to honor
the heroes of Calais.

246
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,017
(applause)

247
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:16,554
Each ship is full of soldiers
just returned from our victory.

248
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:17,589
<i>Long live the king!</i>

249
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,359
Wait till you see the fireworks.

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,593
<i>God bless you, Your Majesty!</i>

251
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,027
Is there anything I
can get you, my dear?

252
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:26,731
Some warm...
mulled wine?

253
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:29,266
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

254
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,169
Leith came to see me.

255
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,871
I made it clear to him that we're over,

256
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,108
that I'm marrying you,
that you're my future.

257
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:39,010
(exhales)

258
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:42,380
You must allow me to be relieved
in not losing the woman I love.

259
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:50,854
(cannon shots)

260
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,924
CASTLEROY: They're firing cannons.

261
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,158
How strange.

262
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,960
I thought they were using fireworks.

263
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,428
It must be safe enough,

264
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:59,897
as long as they don't
point at each other.

265
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:02,298
Well, cannons can be hard to control.

266
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,536
The sound of victory.
The sound of France.

267
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:08,505
Doesn't that excite you?

268
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:14,210
(cannon fires)

269
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,978
(screaming)

270
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:17,947
(gasping)

271
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,882
My God, Leith is
on one of those ships.

272
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,551
Those who aren't
blown to bits won't survive.

273
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:23,886
The water's freezing. I told
them to fire with care!

274
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:26,056
Who's manning the guns,
a pet monkey?

275
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,323
Wait, you actually told
them to fire the cannons?

276
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:32,327
What kind of spectacle would
mere fireworks have been, hmm?

277
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:36,165
Well, never mind.

278
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,934
I refuse to have you disappointed, Mary.

279
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:42,504
This... is all for you, you know.

280
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,473
There'll be another chance
tomorrow. Tomorrow?

281
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:46,875
When we'll do it again!
Properly this time!

282
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,054
A hundred men dead like that.

283
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:57,610
Life so carelessly taken. I feel
like I'm the one losing my mind.

284
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,112
Mary, there's something you should know.

285
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,150
Henry asked for an annulment once more.

286
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,212
It can only mean he wishes
to end our marriage

287
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,009
and turn to someone else.

288
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,156
You.

289
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,259
- No.
- I saw what he did to you.

290
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,827
That came out of nowhere.

291
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,363
He's never shown the
slightest bit of interest.

292
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:20,065
When he had his hands on you,
he had his hands on England.

293
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,837
So he's decided to wed me,
then keep all three crowns for himself.

294
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:29,842
Thus his suddenly generous acceptance of
the fact that you are not pregnant... yet.

295
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,710
He wants to give you an heir himself.

296
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,112
And the spectacle, the carnage...

297
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,145
- Botched display of his prowess.
- Does he honestly think

298
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,017
that Francis and I would agree
to have our marriage annulled?

299
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,019
It's ridiculous!

300
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,621
(gasps)

301
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,892
No.

302
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,159
Even he wouldn't.

303
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,229
He's going to kill his own son!

304
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,298
If you're right,

305
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,167
our only chance is to overtake
him and his guards.

306
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:00,047
Assuming that Francis is able
to persuade the generals

307
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:00,971
to join us in a coup.

308
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,640
If Francis comes back

309
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,542
at the head of an army,
we'll know he succeeded.

310
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,877
If he comes back alone,

311
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,113
we have no protection from Henry,
and neither does Francis.

312
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:14,184
(horse snorts)

313
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:26,760
- (horse neighs)
- You there, what's this?

314
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:27,659
What is this?

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,302
What happened here?
I beg of you, speak freely.

316
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:35,872
The greatest naval spectacle
of all time, my lord.

317
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:37,674
That is, until the ship exploded.

318
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,843
The king replaced the
fireworks with gunpowder.

319
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:42,146
Can you believe they
survived Calais for this?

320
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,179
These soldiers are from Calais?

321
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,875
There'll be twice as many
tomorrow when they do it again.

322
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,216
That's impossible.

323
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:49,702
- No one would do this again.
- Begging your pardon,

324
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:50,486
but you would think no one

325
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,987
would do it the first time,
wouldn't you?

326
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:54,690
Still, you've got to wonder
who's worse off,

327
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,693
these poor fellows
or the ones shipping off for England.

328
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,328
At least for them it was quick.

329
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:01,496
No one is shipping out.

330
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:02,798
King's orders.

331
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,600
Tell that to the 3,000 men
leaving tomorrow night.

332
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,439
CHRISTIAN: You want me to join a coup?

333
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,610
MARY: You may have Henry's
favor today, but it can't last.

334
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:17,679
The king's behavior is getting
more erratic every day.

335
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,283
News of his madness will spread,
contenders for the throne will appear,

336
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:23,918
and civil war will follow,
one way or another.

337
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,054
And I can't disagree with your logic,

338
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,191
but we lack one essential
element for a successful coup.

339
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,125
A leader ready and at hand

340
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:33,161
to fill the power vacuum
once the king is gone.

341
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:34,962
Well, Francis will be
the leader, obviously.

342
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,086
He'll be the next king.

343
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:38,933
Francis carries the stain
of his father's mistakes.

344
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:41,535
He represents everything
the coup would be against.

345
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:44,605
We need someone the nobles and
the nation can rally around.

346
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:49,044
You, Mary, bring the promise of empire.

347
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:52,045
Use the promise that someday soon,

348
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:54,548
England and all its power
and riches will be yours.

349
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:59,353
Use this to make yourself the
most powerful person in France.

350
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:01,388
More powerful than my husband?

351
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:03,691
If you want to lay claim to a nation,

352
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,626
take France.

353
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:11,865
BASH: <i>Why would the Darkness</i>

354
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:13,867
<i>bring a young boy
to this place?</i>

355
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:17,470
Every house deserted.
What happened to these people?

356
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:19,740
The area was beset by flood a year ago.

357
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:23,175
The town sits on higher ground.
Why did no one settle here?

358
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:27,046
(groaning)

359
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,697
Not entirely deserted.

360
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:32,652
The family that once lived here.

361
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:35,521
From the stench, I'd say
there was another victim.

362
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:39,625
Pascal's scarf.

363
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:46,866
Oh.

364
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:51,737
This sacrifice is fresh,
a few days old.

365
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:54,466
This is where the blood
on Pascal came from.

366
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:58,744
From the dirt, these picture
have been here a long time.

367
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:02,113
A storm...

368
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:04,182
Fire...

369
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:06,885
- Flood.
- Disasters.

370
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:09,187
- But why draw them here?
- I think they may be depictions

371
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:11,389
of actual events that occurred
in this region.

372
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,958
- The Great Storm?
- Nearly two decades ago.

373
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,561
Years later, the fire that raged
destroyed Angers and the nearby forests.

374
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:21,099
The flood that wiped out
the surrounding areas.

375
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,633
And the blackening of the sun.

376
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,702
The eclipse so recently witnessed.

377
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:27,532
- Are these predictions?
- Accurate predictions.

378
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:32,909
- What does this one mean?
- Stars falling from the sky.

379
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,580
I don't know,
but it's the only one left.

380
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,418
It's a pagan rhyme.

381
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,219
I heard Pascal chanting it to himself.

382
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,788
"I lie behind the star-bright sky.

383
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,289
I do not fear this life's good-bye.

384
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,357
Close your eyes for my caress..."

385
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,330
"...for I am the Darkness."

386
00:17:56,667 --> 00:18:00,037
"I lie behind the star-bright sky.

387
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,171
I do not fear this life's good-bye."

388
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,841
Pascal, why are you saying
that rhyme again?

389
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,075
Are you scared?

390
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:12,915
It's too quiet.

391
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,984
Where are the guards?

392
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,262
(screaming)

393
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:29,798
Come on! Come on!

394
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,934
Come on!

395
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,917
Come on!

396
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,685
(screams)

397
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:40,987
(grunting)

398
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:42,923
(shouts)

399
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:45,159
(screams)

400
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
(gasps) Get back!

401
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,596
Guards!
Guards, help!

402
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:52,331
Your guards are dead,
and soon you will be, too,

403
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,660
but the boy will survive.

404
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,702
Give him to me.

405
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:58,667
- Please leave us!
- I cannot.

406
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:04,610
I am the Darkness, the Devourer,
the feeder of the gods,

407
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,946
but I cannot feed them forever.

408
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:12,366
Pascal, offer her blood to the gods.

409
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:16,345
Appease their hunger
before it grows.

410
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:16,855
(grunts)

411
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,558
(gasps)

412
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,063
(women sobbing)

413
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,269
Excuse me.

414
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,205
I have a list of the officers

415
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,641
on the boat. What's your bloke's name?

416
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,642
Leith Bayard, but I
don't think he was an officer.

417
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,311
The foot soldiers
are laid out elsewhere.

418
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,413
- I can show you.
- Greer!

419
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,516
(gasps) You survived.
You survived.

420
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,952
CATHERINE: <i>This is why
the people love a joust.</i>

421
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:52,557
<i>Seeing nobles knocked
on their asses</i>

422
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,058
<i>after a long war.</i>

423
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,559
(horse neighs)

424
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,433
(courtiers exclaim)

425
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,774
Ah, Lord Montgomery
takes down another opponent.

426
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,944
(Catherine sighs)

427
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:18,181
Where is everybody?
And why are they all so dour?

428
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,250
They're at a joust, not a funeral.

429
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:23,319
Many of them lost loved ones
in your mock battle, Henry.

430
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,488
(trumpet blows fanfare)

431
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:28,794
ANNOUNCER:<i> Hail Queen Mary.</i>

432
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,332
HENRY: Good God, finally.

433
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,668
WOMAN:<i>
It's the English crest. Mary!</i>

434
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,503
My God, she's wearing
the English coat of arms.

435
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,305
WOMAN: <i>The Queen of Scotland!</i>

436
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,106
(cheering)

437
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:46,409
She's all but declaring
herself England's queen.

438
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,180
<i>Mary! Mary! Mary! Mary!</i>

439
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:54,183
<i>Mary! Mary!</i>

440
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:57,720
Who knew all it took
was a statement dress

441
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,421
to get France in the palm of her hands.

442
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:00,790
She is the future.

443
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:03,559
They see that.

444
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:07,496
(whooping)

445
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,633
MAN: I can't see her!

446
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,005
You're ready, aren't you?

447
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,907
It's like we dream the same dreams.

448
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:29,684
<i>- Mary, Mary!
- Long live Queen Mary!</i>

449
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:31,319
(cheering) <i>Queen Mary!</i>

450
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,622
MAN: <i>Is she really taking England?</i>

451
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:36,790
(wild cheering)

452
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:42,230
They've lost control of themselves.
Have they forgotten who the king is?

453
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:44,832
I'll give them something to cheer for.

454
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,602
Halt the competition!

455
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:50,159
I am going to joust
Lord Montgomery.

456
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,573
- Gamekeeper...
- But, Your Majesty, his armor's damaged,

457
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:54,574
he'll need a fresh horse.

458
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:57,277
Then you have much to attend to.

459
00:21:57,278 --> 00:21:59,512
(courtiers cheering)

460
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:04,918
Members of the English
contingent are leaving.

461
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,519
Off to warn Elizabeth.

462
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,122
I hope you know what you're doing.

463
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:09,623
Send your riders after theirs.

464
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,124
If they stop, they may reveal

465
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,793
some English sympathizers
amongst the French.

466
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:17,564
You're squeezing your cousin
Elizabeth's throat, and to what end?

467
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,031
To give the people hope.

468
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:21,801
So they can imagine a brighter future.

469
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:24,738
Such glory you promise.

470
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:27,807
And so cunning you've become.

471
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:29,208
How you've changed

472
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:31,210
since you came back to us from convent.

473
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,946
I miss the girl you were.

474
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:35,681
Many will.

475
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:38,885
She was easier to kill.

476
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:40,987
I love you. I love you.

477
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,022
- I have to secure the door.
- It's locked.

478
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,127
Let me help you undress.

479
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:51,330
Please, just... just hold me,

480
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:52,964
a little more, please.

481
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:55,768
We have no reason to stop.
I want to marry you.

482
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:02,473
Greer, don't do this.

483
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:04,276
I thought you were dead.

484
00:23:04,277 --> 00:23:05,844
I'm not.

485
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:09,414
I'm standing right here before you,
and you should not let me go.

486
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,149
Not for money,
or your family, or anything.

487
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,851
Nothing's changed,

488
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:17,355
except I felt the pain of your loss more
deeply than I ever thought I could.

489
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,157
And you will.

490
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:21,859
I swear to you, Greer,

491
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,328
if you don't take this
chance with me, you will.

492
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:26,931
Marry me.
Marry me!

493
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:29,367
No, Leith, I can't.

494
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,935
I can't!

495
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,318
When you are alone and miserable,

496
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:50,320
remember this is the moment
that you threw your happiness away.

497
00:23:52,757 --> 00:23:55,459
And I'll remember you as the woman
who told me I wasn't enough.

498
00:23:57,194 --> 00:24:00,864
I will become everything you
are so convinced that you need.

499
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:06,936
I will rise and rise and rise,
until I am rich and powerful.

500
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:11,474
But I will never be yours again.

501
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:17,546
(door opens and closes)

502
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,720
- (horse snorts)
- Your lance, Your Highness.

503
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:27,582
ANNOUNCER: <i>His Majesty King Henry</i>

504
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,842
<i>and Lord Montgomery.</i>

505
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:35,264
(cheering)

506
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:40,869
(courtiers whoop)

507
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,144
CATHERINE: I suppose that's good
comeuppance for Montgomery.

508
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:53,284
He will have to take the blows...
it's bad business to outshine your boss.

509
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,887
- (courtiers cheer, whistle)
WOMAN: - <i>King Henry!</i>

510
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:18,139
(gasps)

511
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,474
(courtiers exclaiming)

512
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:25,379
CATHERINE: For God's sake, go to him!

513
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,914
Is the king all right?

514
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:27,915
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

515
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,215
Your Majesty!

516
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:31,752
(murmuring)

517
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,414
The king has been gravely injured!

518
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,366
Where is the physician?!

519
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:38,224
(whinnies) Your Majesty...

520
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:01,238
(screams)

521
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,472
It's all right.

522
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,307
I'm here. Are you hurt?

523
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:05,842
No, but... Bash, look out!

524
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:09,413
(grunting)

525
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,890
(groaning)

526
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,364
Get Kenna and Pascal out of here.

527
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:32,134
Pascal must succeed me,
or the Black Death will awaken.

528
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,502
The Black Death.

529
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:34,971
The plague.

530
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,005
That's what the signs at
Visegard were counting down to.

531
00:26:37,006 --> 00:26:38,807
Bash, I've had visions.

532
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:41,477
The castle beset by death.
Bodies laid out in the hall.

533
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:44,905
It will happen, if my work is not done.

534
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:47,837
Stay with Kenna and Pascal, please.

535
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:51,287
How rare is the gift of sight.
I don't believe you have it.

536
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:54,589
I think you're a killer,
feeding on others' fears.

537
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:02,376
You're pagan-born.

538
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:05,891
Deny it, but in your heart
you know the gods have power.

539
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,689
They demand respect.

540
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,204
Blood.

541
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:10,538
And if they don't get it...

542
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,440
You took the blood, not the gods.

543
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,674
I'm here to save you.

544
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:18,379
I took my people into the Blood Wood
and showed them how to feed the gods,

545
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,548
and since that day the
plague has not returned.

546
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:24,852
But the gods hold it leashed,
in the shadows,

547
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:29,556
and if I die without a successor,
it will run wild over the land.

548
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:33,343
Bring Pascal to me,
and I will save your world.

549
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:35,528
His father knew it was his fate.

550
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,563
- He understood the honor.
- No.

551
00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:42,636
No more children, no more sacrifices,
and the slaughter of innocents ends here.

552
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:43,703
It can't end!

553
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,639
(both yell)

554
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,215
FRANCIS: <i>Does he live yet?</i>

555
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,750
He lingers.

556
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:59,795
He won't survive; they say he can't.

557
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:02,054
There's pieces of the lance
stuck in his brain.

558
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,491
- Is this what we wanted?
- It isn't.

559
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,761
Henry's fall was out of
our hands completely.

560
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:11,596
Is that not God's will?

561
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:13,904
Now no more blood needs to be spilled.

562
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:15,000
None but my father's.

563
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:17,703
We should say good-bye.

564
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:27,945
In spite of our feelings,

565
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:31,015
I've always tried to do what's been
best for our children and for you.

566
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,117
And for France.

567
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:35,353
Shh, there are no more regrets.

568
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:40,024
In my way,
I have always loved you.

569
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,327
(whispering)
You are the love of my life.

570
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,732
Oh, to see your kindness returned...

571
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,901
Yours must, as well.

572
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,736
It's in you still.

573
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:54,738
You must show it to Diane.

574
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:57,608
She is unprotected once I'm gone.

575
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:01,445
After being so much a part
of my life, of ours...

576
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:03,046
neither of you should be alone.

577
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:07,984
She is extended family,
your equal in s...

578
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:09,820
so many ways.

579
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:11,188
Catherine...

580
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:15,225
be friends.

581
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:18,561
Please reach out to her.

582
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:20,663
Yes.

583
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:23,767
I will reach out to her.

584
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:27,937
Rest now, Henry.

585
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:31,974
Rest long.

586
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:33,976
Francis, now.

587
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:35,345
Just Francis.

588
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:52,394
(door opens)

589
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:58,300
(door closes)

590
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,535
Francis, what have you
come to say to me?

591
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:04,038
Must we right every wrong?

592
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,409
I'm not sure what you mean, Father.

593
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:11,446
Oh, it's you.

594
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:17,285
Did I tell you that you were
named after my elder brother?

595
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:20,255
He was to be king. He feared the job,

596
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:23,057
the giving and taking
of lives to a cause.

597
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:28,496
He was like you in that way, too.

598
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:33,634
I thought him weak.

599
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:36,103
I knew I would be a better king.

600
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:42,109
It was a competition all along.

601
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:48,115
Such games we play
against those we love.

602
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:51,551
I won it all.

603
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,287
On a tennis court of all places.

604
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:58,762
When he collapsed
after I poisoned his water.

605
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:05,699
You killed your brother.

606
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,701
No one ever knew.

607
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:13,239
Now I know why you
warned me against my brother.

608
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,029
Turned me against Sebastian.

609
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:21,715
Betraying someone you love
blackens your soul.

610
00:31:21,716 --> 00:31:26,853
It's a weight you carry
all of your days.

611
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:35,627
Can I let it go now?

612
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,389
God forgive me.

613
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,130
MAN: <i>The king is dead.</i>

614
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,231
<i>Long live the king!</i>

615
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,968
MAN 2: <i>The king is dead.
Long live the king!</i>

616
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,004
MAN 3: <i>The king is dead.
Long live the king!</i>

617
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,773
MAN 4: <i>The king is dead.
Long live the king!</i>

618
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,074
MAN 5: <i>The king is dead.
Long live the king!</i>

619
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:45,864
(indistinct chatter)

620
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,102
(short laugh)
Well, hello there.

621
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:52,003
Leith. Do you recall?

622
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,740
Yvette. Rhymes with
"How could I forget?"

623
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:59,997
A new government is forming
between toasts and whispers.

624
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,313
So let's have that drink now.

625
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,349
What changed?

626
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,818
You were in such a hurry
when last we met.

627
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,255
I wasn't thirsty then.
I am now.

628
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:12,457
Another time.

629
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,808
As this hour, I am destined
to meet another.

630
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,194
- Aren't you a heartbreaker?
- Not at all.

631
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:20,131
Don't you be one, either.

632
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:31,375
- You're late.
- Only barely.

633
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,277
I couldn't leave right
away as I'd spent hours

634
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,324
waiting for you, bored senseless,

635
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,248
and then suddenly, I...

636
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,849
Oh, Father.

637
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,252
My evening took
the loveliest turn. (laughs)

638
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,354
(Lola screaming)

639
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,291
Word's back from the village.

640
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,994
The midwife's taken ill herself
and is no condition to travel.

641
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,663
The baby should have come by now.

642
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:53,997
Yes. It should have.

643
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,566
I fear for its life, and yours as well.

644
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,034
I don't mean to scare you.

645
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:01,204
Are there words you want
written down in case?

646
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,238
Yes.

647
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,673
But if there's any way

648
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,073
you can save the baby...

649
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:07,442
None that wouldn't kill you.
Or that I'm equipped for.

650
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:14,416
"My dear friend, Mary.

651
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:18,720
I am alone and my child
struggles to join this world.

652
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:24,592
I release you from your promise,
from the protection our secret gave me.

653
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:30,832
For Julien has died. And I'm
afraid I may soon join him.

654
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,401
Please, bring help.

655
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:36,871
But if I die and the child survives,

656
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:39,740
care for my baby
as if it were your own.

657
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:41,642
With Francis."

658
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:48,349
- Your friend is Mary, Queen of Scots?
- Yes.

659
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,451
Please, have it taken to the castle.

660
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:53,054
(groaning) And hurry!

661
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:56,557
Bash.

662
00:34:56,558 --> 00:35:00,527
I'm so sorry about your father.

663
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:05,577
I don't know what my
place is here anymore.

664
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:06,800
Your place is with me.

665
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:08,580
- No, I meant...
- I know what you meant.

666
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:11,938
You don't need your father's name or to
slay every dragon to be worth something.

667
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:14,807
You've done enough.
You are enough.

668
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:17,277
Now you deserve some
happiness of your own.

669
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:20,247
I think I found it in you.

670
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:21,414
I love you.

671
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:23,816
I love you, too.

672
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,718
What a miracle.

673
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:29,722
(short laugh)

674
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:30,757
(gasps)

675
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:31,791
Look!

676
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:34,494
Shooting star.

677
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:37,597
Ooh, another one.

678
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:42,502
The stars are falling.

679
00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:45,470
It's the final sign before the
Darkness said it would return.

680
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:46,838
He said it would sweep the land.

681
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:48,240
What would?

682
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:51,176
The plague.

683
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:52,644
(door opens)

684
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,079
MARY: <i>Francis, you haven't slept!</i>

685
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,318
The nobles and my father's advisors
were in my ear all night.

686
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:04,188
- I am the King of France.
- Yes, you are.

687
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:07,191
I never wanted it to happen this way.

688
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:12,030
Fearing my own father,
hating him at the end.

689
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:15,700
I saw the bodies of those men
that drowned in those boats.

690
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:17,468
Heroes slaughtered.

691
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:21,406
- I saw the way that he touched your face.
- You were at the tournament?

692
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,544
Mary, I know that you said
that my father's death

693
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:28,947
- was God's will...
- Francis, it was.

694
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:32,350
Although some people
would question a God

695
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:34,652
who grants us such power,
based on nothing

696
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,320
but the fortune of our birth.

697
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,456
It isn't fair,

698
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,891
the privileges we are given.

699
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:43,494
And the price we must pay for them.

700
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:48,131
I can feel myself changing.

701
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:50,100
And not for the better.

702
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:52,035
Every choice I have made

703
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:55,372
to protect France and
Scotland, even you,

704
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:57,975
for all of them there is a reckoning.

705
00:36:57,976 --> 00:37:00,743
And it's always the woman
who must bow to the queen.

706
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:03,681
I feel like I'm killing part of myself.

707
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:07,884
But I'm ignoring my heart until
it becomes blind and deaf.

708
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:11,888
I can feel myself growing
harder and I worry that I...

709
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:15,257
that I'm becoming someone
you will not love.

710
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:17,627
Then don't.

711
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:20,363
Don't grow harder, share your burdens,

712
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:23,366
tell me your darkest truths, and I...

713
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,234
I will tell you mine.

714
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:28,270
So we don't end up married but alone,

715
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:30,939
two people going down separate paths,

716
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,176
justifying our sins as acts of survival.

717
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:37,046
If we can forgive each
other, perhaps we can

718
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,881
forgive ourselves.

719
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,516
(door opens)

720
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:41,917
Excuse me, Your Grace,

721
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:44,219
but there's an urgent
letter from Lady Lola.

722
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:48,891
Thank you.

723
00:37:55,464 --> 00:37:57,365
Lola's giving birth.

724
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,635
Julien is dead, and she is all alone.

725
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:01,802
Where is she?

726
00:38:01,803 --> 00:38:04,372
Uh, at-at a house by the mill.

727
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:14,081
You should go.

728
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:15,382
Me?

729
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:18,185
You.

730
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:22,456
Because you are the father of her child.

731
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:25,059
Because I've wanted
to tell you for months.

732
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,995
Because, finally, Lola wants
you to know it, too.

733
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:31,765
Francis, she writes
that she may not survive.

734
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:33,733
There is no time to lose.

735
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:37,971
Be there when, God willing,
your child comes into the world.

736
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:41,575
Hurry, and I will come and join you
after I have gathered some help.

737
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:44,178
- All this time...
- I will explain after.

738
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:47,080
But for now I beg you,
be by her side.

739
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,685
Go.

740
00:38:57,324 --> 00:39:00,359
I need a doctor.

741
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,761
Or a midwife. Lola needs help.

742
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:04,797
No one will be leaving
or entering the castle.

743
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:07,032
Not for some time.
I'll speak with the guards.

744
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:09,302
The portcullis will be lowered,
all gates will be secured.

745
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,970
Why? What's happening?

746
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:12,205
Word has come from surrounding villages.

747
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:13,372
People are dying of plague.

748
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:14,707
Standing in the same room

749
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,875
with someone who is ill risks infection.

750
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,711
- I know what the plague does.
- People are already

751
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:20,312
hiding their sick
for fear of being locked

752
00:39:20,313 --> 00:39:21,379
in their homes with them.

753
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,380
But, Lola, she...

754
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:23,649
You cannot help her.

755
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,185
Francis is leaving the castle
to go and be with her!

756
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:28,386
Stop him!

757
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:35,460
MARY: Francis, wait!

758
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:36,528
Thank God you haven't left.

759
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:37,562
What is it?

760
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:38,997
People are dying.

761
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:40,565
The plague has come and it's spreading.

762
00:39:40,566 --> 00:39:42,033
Your mother has ordered
the castle locked down.

763
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:43,401
Lola is not far from here.

764
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:44,569
I shall return with her and the baby.

765
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,104
No, Francis, you can't leave.

766
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:47,539
You urged me to be by her side.

767
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,040
You know she shouldn't be alone now.

768
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,675
It's a terrible decision,

769
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,077
but it's our duty as
rulers to make the right one.

770
00:39:53,078 --> 00:39:55,813
You are going to a village
which has likely been exposed

771
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:57,548
to plague. If you bring back people

772
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:58,647
who may have been
infected with it...

773
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:02,253
"People"? Your friend.
My child, perhaps my only child.

774
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:07,491
You're not just risking your life,
but everyone in this castle.

775
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:10,270
If you leave, and you return
with anybody who is ill...

776
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,895
Mary, you said you felt
yourself growing harder.

777
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:12,896
Don't let it happen.

778
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:17,067
Listen to your heart, and you
will hear it as clearly as I do.

779
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:19,528
You are the king of France!

780
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:21,805
You no longer have the privilege
of obeying your heart!

781
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:23,774
That's not the kind of
king that I want to be.

782
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,048
Lower the gates.

783
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:33,316
But King Francis... Is aware
of the threat to us all.

784
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:35,485
Lower the gates now.

785
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:56,834
