<i>- Previously on Reign...
- Lord Castleroy.</i>

8
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:34,965
I know I'm not the man of your dreams.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,834
Will you accept my humble proposal?

10
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,636
We're married, we can't be unmarried.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,238
<i>I thought we'd agree to at least try.</i>

12
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:42,507
- Henry, end this now.
- Leave, Penelope.

13
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,742
Get out. Now!

14
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,376
- Henry, no!
- While the king feels forgiving.

<i>FRANCIS: If word gets out of his madness,</i>

16
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:48,578
<i>this country could come apart.</i>

17
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:50,147
I was paid to murder the Queen

18
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,982
of Scots on her voyage home.

19
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:54,484
- We'll go when it's safe.
- My mother's in jeopardy now.

20
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,520
Scotland is in jeopardy now.

21
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:59,657
<i>- Guards, surround the queen.
- Locked in the tower?</i>

22
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:01,391
But I have done this for you.

23
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,726
I love you, and I've put you first.

24
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:05,928
You can't just leave me
locked in here. Francis!

25
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:08,632
Francis!

26
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,070
(cries): No!

27
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:15,705
Gabriel commanded my best archer corps.

28
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:19,909
Some of his men were twice his age.

29
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:21,778
But they all loved him.

30
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,579
He sang to them at night.

31
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:26,082
He sang of this place.

32
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:28,785
His home.

33
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,587
Your brother died fighting
for his home, his people.

34
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,322
With great bravery.

35
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:41,129
I understand you lost a son today.

36
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,965
But I lost a soldier, and only
one of those can be remedied.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,602
Gabriel's men followed him
because he was a nobleman.

38
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,905
They will follow his brother

39
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,273
for the same good reason.

40
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,308
Please. We don't need your money.

41
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:56,311
Martin's only 14. He's too young.

42
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,080
A year older than I was
when I first saw combat.

43
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:00,315
My lord duke, I can't allow it.

44
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,316
You can.

45
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,685
And you will.

46
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:08,090
Would you ask my men
to sacrifice themselves

47
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:11,226
for the protection of estates
that won't sacrifice for them?

48
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:16,764
Be proud of your sons.

49
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:17,932
I am.

65
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,805
we were all talking about our first kisses?

66

Now you're all married.

And soon you will be as well.

68
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,143
Unless I ruin it before then.

69
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,011
Or my father does.

70
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:06,679
He's arriving today, and I'm worried

71
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,782
he'll offend Lord Castleroy
with too small a dowry.

72
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:10,183
We can't afford much.

73
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,350
Have you told Lord Castleroy

74
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:12,819
your family's lost its fortune?

75
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:14,320
He might be understanding.

76
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,721
Tell a suitor we're broke?

77
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,523
My father would have a heart attack.

78
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,659
(laughs) I've had more opportunities

79
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:21,627
than you can count.

80
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:23,362
And what do I do?

81
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:24,463
Fall in love with a servant

82
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,031
and nearly ruin his life, too.

83
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,966
We've all had the same
opportunity, and look at us.

84
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,469
I never dreamt that I'd be wed to a bastard

85
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:32,004
with an imaginary title.

86
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:33,338
Lola's been forced to hide her pregnancy.

87
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,507
Even Mary and Francis...

88
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,812
Yes, when we couldn't come
to terms on my brother,

89
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,815
my beloved husband locked me in a tower.

90
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,350
It's been almost a month.

91
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,686
Are you and Francis on any better terms?

92
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,521
Well, I can now talk to
him without screaming.

93
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:51,356
Does that count as "better"?

94
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,891
(door opens)

95
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,928
Your Majesty? I have
dire news from Scotland.

96
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,163
It's about your mother, Marie de Guise.

97
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,834
The Protestants and their
Lords of the Congregation

98
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,436
have sent an army to besiege
my mother in Edinburgh.

99
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,672
There are men outside the
castle demanding her surrender.

100
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,042
Her friends don't know how much
longer she can hold out for.

101
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,844
Mary, I'm so sorry.

102
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,678
My brother James warned
us that the Protestants

103
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,914
were planning a rebellion
against my mother.

104
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,850
If I had gone with him,
I could have stopped it.

105
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,384
Or you could've been killed.

106
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:21,918
This news only proves it.

107
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,787
It's too bad we couldn't protect my mother

108
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,856
by locking her in the
tower as you did with me.

109
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,857
Instead of arguing,

110
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,225
let's help her.

111
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,960
Your mother needs soldiers and quickly.

112
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:31,061
And how are we supposed to get them?

113
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:32,396
Certainly not from your father.

114
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,030
Armies can be bought.

115
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,599
Who has that kind of money?

116
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,133
My mother.

117
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,268
Francis, I've already asked your mother.

118
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:39,469
More than once.

119
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,071
She's always said no.

120
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,805
Then we will ask her together.

121
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,175
And we will keep asking until she says yes.

122
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,216
Mother, we need to talk.

123
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,385
I realize that.

124
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,387
Why do you think I sent for you two?

125
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,154
Oh, you sent for us? So
you've heard the news then?

126
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:00,256
I'm sorry, Mary.

127
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,824
You must be crushed.

128
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,926
Well, I'm worried, I'm not crushed.

129
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,595
There's still time to send reinforcements.

130
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,229
Oh, dear.

131
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:10,465
I don't think we're
talking about the same news.

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,935
Have you not heard about the succession?

133
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:14,336
Whose succession?

134
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,737
Not yours, I'm afraid.

135
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,139
Word came from England.

136
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:18,473
It's official.

137
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:21,944
Elizabeth will be their next queen.

138
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,079
- Mary Tudor's dead?
- HENRY: No!

139
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:26,348
The old bitch is still
clinging to her miserable life.

140
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:28,116
But she managed to cough up the gall

141
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,018
to hand over her crown to Elizabeth.

142
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,354
A bastard, a Protestant no
less, and not my son's wife!

143
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,189
Are you even pregnant yet?

144
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:37,459
Could you possibly be
any less use to France?

145
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,127
Do not talk to my wife that way.

146
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:40,529
She's a queen and an ally.

147
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:42,363
She was supposed to get me England!

148
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:44,365
We've been feeding

149
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,035
and housing this ally

150
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,502
for most of her pointless life.

151
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:49,804
And what have we gotten?

152
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:52,006
A drain on our treasure and army,

153
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,607
an endless parade

154
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:55,876
of dramas and headaches.

155
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,778
Scotland protects France

156
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:59,680
by engaging the English on two fronts

157
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:02,616
so it cannot focus its
force on growing its foothold

158
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:04,117
on your backyard, Calais.

159
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:06,454
I don't need a lecture
from you on geography.

160
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:07,822
Scotland cannot blunt

161
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:10,223
the English threat alone, Your Grace.

162
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,359
- Especially not now!
- Yes, I've heard all about it.

163
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:13,527
Protestants threatening your mother.

164
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,995
She needs reinforcements

165
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,896
- just like always.
- No, not just like always.

166
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:19,166
She is under siege.

167
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,700
There are soldiers at her gates!

168
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,801
And now you're afraid

169
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,370
your poor mother might die?

170
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,505
Well, don't we owe it
to Scotland and France,

171
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,343
as rulers, to ask if that
might be a good thing?

172
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:32,145
Your mother can't handle
the job that you gave her.

173
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,680
Or else she wouldn't be under siege!

174
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:36,516
Father, stop this.
Mary's crown is at stake,

175
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,585
which puts France at risk as well.

176
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:41,654
More than her crown is
at stake. Your mother

177
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:44,491
failed us completely. And now they want

178
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,192
her head on a pike.

179
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:48,160
Be careful.

180
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:50,296
Or yours might follow.

181
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:57,564
No one?

182
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,734
Not one country or lord offers help?

183
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:03,137
My mother is a Catholic ally.

184
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,772
She is under attack.

185
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:07,407
Enemies screaming for her
head, and no one cares?

186
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,309
Scotland has many friends at court.

187
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:10,843
But every conversation I have

188
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,979
with a noble or diplomat ends the same way.

189
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:15,748
"We're with you, Dauphin,
but what does the king say?"

190
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,450
I hope you didn't tell them.

191
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,787
Mary, I should never have let my father...

192
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,322
Words don't bother me.

193
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,158
You are safe in this castle.

194
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:26,325
Not even my mother...

195
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,994
Threats don't bother me, either.

196
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,528
Losing bothers me.

197
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:30,997
Mary, that's silly, you're...

198
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,332
A queen? Yes, I am.

199
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,101
But one with scant power here.

200
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,803
And less every day back home.

201
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:40,105
On the other hand,

202
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,640
I'm also queen

203
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:43,041
because I'm a de Guise.

204
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,211
I have very powerful uncles.

205
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,845
I hope you're not thinking...

206
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,847
My mother is surrounded on all sides.

207
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:52,518
Protestants are burning and
pillaging Catholic churches.

208
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,853
Why would they stop their
campaign of destruction

209
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,888
before making sure I lose
my mother and my crown?

210
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,724
But the Duke of Guise?

211
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,826
Ever since you've been
back at court, you've chosen

212
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,893
to keep your distance from him.

213
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:03,195
The same as my parents have.

214
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,996
Your uncle is a dangerously

215
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,497
ambitious man, who has
built himself an army

216
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,333
by stealing recruits from their mothers.

217
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,367
And paying them well.

218
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,501
Do you know anyone else

219
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:11,902
with an army as large or as loyal?

220
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:12,970
Loyal to him.

221
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:14,739
And him only.

222
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,241
Is that someone that you can trust?

223
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:18,175
He is my uncle.

224
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,177
If that doesn't buy me his loyalty...

225
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:21,746
well...

226
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,682
Trust is a luxury I can no longer afford.

227
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:33,157
Sorry, you're not to be let
in under any circumstances.

228
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,658
Do you know who I am?

229
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:36,894
You're the contest winner the king enjoyed.

230
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,595
And then cast aside.

231
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,165
Penelope, what are you doing here?

232
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:43,067
Surely a bounty of demeaning tasks

233
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,235
awaits you in the kitchen.

234
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,503
I need to see the king immediately.

235
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,372
I'm pregnant.

236
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:49,673
With his child.

237
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:51,408
You're not pregnant.

238
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,843
Even if you are, it's
not with the king's child.

239
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:55,345
Well, the king will want to know.

240
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,214
He's going to wonder if he's got

241
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,166
another chance at happiness.

242
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:01,437
Another chance at a child

243
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,672
- he could truly love!
- Shut her up now.

244
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:05,175
Henry, I love you and I miss you!

245
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,642
And I'm carrying your child!

246
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,347
You're pregnant?

247
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:13,116
You're certain it's my child?

248
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,318
There's been no one else, Your Majesty.

249
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:16,652
I was a maiden when you took me.

250
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:17,786
CATHERINE: Oh, that's nonsense.

251
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,121
See that she's taken care of.

252
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:20,456
Set her up with a cottage

253
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,790
in one of the villages.

254
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:23,959
Oh!

255
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:25,661
I have some mistresses.

256
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:27,663
In Bernay, I think.

257
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:30,799
The child could have
siblings to play with, huh?

258
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,368
Wait.

259
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:34,136
That's all I get?

260
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,637
Henry!

261
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:38,140
It's more than you deserve.

262
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,212
Are you sure you want
to be playing this game?

263
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:41,550
If you overplay it,

264
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:43,218
if he loses patience with your displays,

265
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:45,153
you won't like how it ends.

266
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:47,890
The two dead girls before you didn't.

267
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:48,991
Nothing bothers me more than problems

268
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,992
I've already solved coming back

269
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,727
to be problems again.

270
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:55,029
If that's what you make
of yourself, my child,

271
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:57,999
expect me to make you a
lesson to my other problems

272
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:00,001
by grinding you into the dust

273
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:02,537
you no longer see fit to sweep.

274
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:20,554
Oh-oh-oh! Oh, I've
missed you two so much!

275
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,192
Father.

276
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:26,560
Where's Mother?

277
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:28,395
She's at home with your other sisters.

278
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,431
I've only brought these two
so you could introduce them

279
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,898
to potential suitors.

280
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,235
Aren't they a little young
to be looking for husbands?

281
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,603
Considering all the
trouble we've had with you,

282
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:37,371
I regret not bringing them sooner.

283
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:40,540
And I hope you haven't made too
large a mess for me to clean up.

284
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:41,875
I realize I made a mistake,

285
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,877
but it's not as bad as you may have heard.

286
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,278
No? Tell me, will there be

287
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,748
any surprises for Lord
Castleroy on your wedding night?

288
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:49,783
Anything he can accuse you of later?

289
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,218
No, it didn't go that far.

290
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,987
Does that embarrass you?

291
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:55,789
Then imagine how it embarrassed the family.

292
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,990
I may sound harsh, but
it's for your own good.

293
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,059
You can't afford to lose another suitor.

294
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,461
Do I have it wrong?

295
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,096
No, Father.

296
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:06,899
(door creaks)

297
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,435
I stopped by our new house on the way back.

298
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,638
It needs work before we can live there.

299
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,973
Especially if we want to
bring it to your standards.

300
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,908
Oh, Bash, that's lovely,

301
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,310
but what happened out
there? You've been out

302
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,138
in those woods for weeks

303
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,013
hunting that creature.
Have you found it yet?

304
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,682
The Darkness?

305
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,284
No sign of it yet, but
it's only a matter of time.

306
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,286
The Blood Wood is vast, but not limitless.

307
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,588
Have you been all right?

308
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,123
I hope there haven't been any
more encounters with the king.

309
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,426
I've been staying out of his way.

310
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,195
Waiting for you to return.

311
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,202
(both moan)

312
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,370
Why do you stop?

313
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,338
It's not our first kiss.

314
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,174
You're my husband, it's all right.

315
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,109
It's not as though I'm inexperienced.

316
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,677
I'm well aware of that.

317
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,846
Well, if you wanted a virgin...

318
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,348
No, I don't. But I care
about your experience.

319
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,450
I know not all of it has been good.

320
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,119
There's no changing that now.

321
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,886
I disagree.

322
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,389
♪ And gone in the blink
of my eye, gone, gone ♪

323
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,391
♪ Gone, in the blink of my eye ♪

324
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,792
What are you doing?

325
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:12,730
Helping you forget everything and everyone

326
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,732
that's come before this.

327
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,968
Tell me what you want...

328
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:20,503
very specifically. Leave nothing out.

329
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:21,739
All right.

330
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,240
♪ Gone, gone, gone ♪

331
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:26,409
♪ In the blink of my, blink of my eye ♪

332
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,085
(moans)

333
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:40,390
Do you have any idea what you've done?

334
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:43,493
Francis, you should have
talked her out of this madness.

335
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:44,761
You should have helped her.

336
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:45,895
(horses neighing)

337
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,131
I know you're a student of history.

338
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,966
Perhaps you missed this chapter:

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,268
the duke was dismissed
from your father's court

340
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:53,502
for grasping at too much power.

341
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:55,638
And you know what he did then?

342
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:58,141
He fielded that army to grasp at more.

343
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:02,679
He's a vicious self-serving
killer, a threat to any throne.

344
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:06,482
Coming from you, that's
a ringing endorsement.

345
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:09,385
I wouldn't be so smug, my dear.

346
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:14,356
You just let the devil into our home.

347
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:21,661
Thank you so much for coming, Uncle.

348
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:24,331
We wish it was under better circumstances.

349
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:25,732
Like your wedding, perhaps?

350
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,234
I seem to have missed my invitation

351
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,137
to that happy event, Your Grace.

352
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:31,371
The wedding was very rushed.

353
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,839
I hope you took no offense.

354
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:36,142
Nonsense. Don't trouble
yourself over niceties. I don't.

355
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,077
Dauphin.

356
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:39,913
The king and queen send their regards.

357
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:42,482
They regret not greeting you personally,

358
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:44,383
but urgent matters demand their attention.

359
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,018
You don't have to make excuses.

360
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:48,087
I'm aware of your parents' opinion of me.

361
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,590
And from what I hear, even
when your father is present,

362
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:54,160
the king is no longer in the castle.

363
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:57,830
I don't know what rumors
you've heard, sir, but...

364
00:13:57,864 --> 00:13:59,898
Call me Christian, and
let's spare ourselves

365
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,867
lots of pointless formality and posturing.

366
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,937
I have friends who tell me
what goes on in this castle.

367
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,605
I know why you asked for me,

368
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,074
and I'm here to get you out of the hole

369
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:10,408
my sister's incompetence put you in.

370
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:14,092
Very well, no posturing.

371
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:16,264
My mother is in danger, but I'm guessing

372
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,100
that it will take more than
family loyalty to buy your help.

373
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,869
So what will it be?

374
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,537
Money? Land?

375
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,972
Neither.

376
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:27,876
Your father dismissed
me from court years ago.

377
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,711
I want a position in court again.

378
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,146
A more permanent one.

379
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,981
Lord Magistrate of France will do.

380
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:36,051
The lord magistrate is
the king's right hand.

381
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,052
You want a better position than
the one that you were stripped of

382
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,721
after you challenged your king?

383
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,956
I didn't challenge my king, I served him.

384
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,224
By appointing generals

385
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,659
without his permission and doling out

386
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:45,926
political patronage to your friends?

387
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,428
While your father was busy

388
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:50,598
producing heirs, bastards and
otherwise, he needed my help,

389
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,500
whether he cared to admit it or not.

390
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:54,335
He needed your loyalty,

391
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,470
whether you cared to provide it or not.

392
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:59,773
I can make your army serve
me for nothing if I wanted.

393
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,308
I have that authority.

394
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,744
They're right outside if you'd like to try.

395
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,512
I just don't know how many

396
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,614
will still be around tomorrow if I'm not.

397
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:10,417
They're loyal to the man
who pays them, not the boy

398
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,985
who waves crowns at them.

399
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,422
We'll consider the terms
and present them to Henry.

400
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,956
Uncle.

401
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,162
Your father will never agree.

402
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,298
He has to.

403
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:29,702
Or you'll lose Scotland, and so will we.

404
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,204
(Penelope moaning)

405
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,708
Hurry up! I mean, I
want you and everything,

406
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,043
but we must be quick.

407
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,878
(chickens cackling)

408
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,316
What's the meaning of this?

409
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,719
Sorry, Your Majesty, I was just...

410
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:49,021
I know what you were
just, you vile little man.

411
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,724
Have you no decency?

412
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,893
Laying your hands on a
favorite of your king?

413
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:57,229
Leave, before I have you
thrown in the dungeon!

414
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:01,400
(door opens, closes)

415
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,303
I hope he didn't hurt you.

416
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,406
- No.
- I got here just in time, didn't I?

417
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,474
If that man had had his way,

418
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:11,876
he'd be able to claim your unborn child,

419
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:13,979
and where would that
leave you with the king?

420
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,247
I'm already pregnant.

421
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,014
My child is the king's.

422
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,883
Then I'm sure you'll agree
it's not just yourself

423
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,485
that you need to protect anymore.

424
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,588
The life of the king's
unborn baby is at stake.

425
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:25,356
We simply can't risk that.

426
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,292
You need to go somewhere safe.

427
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,664
The king will be outraged when he finds out

428
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:36,533
you're locking me and his baby in here.

429
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:39,503
No, the king will be outraged
when "his" baby comes out

430
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:41,238
looking more like one of his stable boys.

431
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:44,442
Or, more likely, no baby comes out at all.

432
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:46,877
Neither of those things will happen.

433
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:50,246
Enjoy your solitude, my dear.

434
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,516
I'll drop by every month or so

435
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,318
to share in the joy of
watching your belly grow.

436
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,523
Wait! Don't leave me here!

437
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:03,927
A word of advice from someone who knows:

438
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:06,296
don't make friends with
the rats. They bite.

439
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,867
Wait, wait.

440
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:16,206
Greer tells me her sisters have
never been to a castle before.

441
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,808
I say we give them the royal tour.

442
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,576
That can wait.

443
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,112
I'd like to discuss the matter

444
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:23,813
of Greer's dowry as soon as possible.

445
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,148
Now? In front of your daughters?

446
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,717
We don't need to discuss Greer's dowry.

447
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:29,952
I've given the matter some
thought, and I'm not interested.

448
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:31,687
Not interested?

449
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:34,590
Then what is it you want?

450
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,559
Only your blessing for her hand.

451
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,897
You have it, my lord.

452
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,266
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

453
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,514
(clears throat) I need to speak
with you, Father. It's urgent.

454
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,983
- Nothing is more urgent than war.
- I agree.

455
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:03,184
That's why I came to discuss

456
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:04,986
- a solution for Scotland.
- All this time

457
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:07,121
we've been waiting for Mary
Tudor to give us England.

458
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:09,858
To allow us the privilege of
putting your wife on the throne.

459
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:11,760
But the English don't wait.

460
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:14,469
They take what they want,

461
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,070
just like they took Calais from us.

462
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,072
So I'm going to take it back.

463
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:21,175
After that, I'll take all of England.

464
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,843
We'll attack from Scotland in the north

465
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:24,479
and Calais in the south.

466
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:27,047
When they wake up tomorrow
to see French soldiers

467
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:30,550
massing around Calais,
we might even get lucky.

468
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,552
They might surrender to spare
themselves certain defeat.

469
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:34,855
Tomorrow? How could you... ?

470
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:37,658
I can't wait to see the
look on Mary Tudor's face

471
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:39,326
when I claim the English throne for myself.

472
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,997
I just hope that sick cow lives long enough

473
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,565
- for me to execute her.
- Father, tomorrow?

474
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,033
What have you done?

475
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:48,335
Can't you read?!

476
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:50,637
General Brantome's men are moving

477
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,171
northeast from Rouen as we speak.

478
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:53,439
<i>General Brantome?</i>

479
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:55,775
I had to relieve Laval. No imagination.

480
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,276
No courage.

481
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,813
Stop babbling, Father,
and tell me the truth.

482
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,015
- Did you do this?
- Why wouldn't I?

483
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,185
We don't have the strength to take Calais.

484
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:09,288
Our armies are spread
too thin, all over Europe!

485
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,990
If we lose, and they capture our forces,

486
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,459
they can stage an invasion

487
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:16,595
and sweep down through France unopposed!

488
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,667
But Francis, we can't lose!

489
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:19,902
Yes, we can,

490
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:21,303
and we will!

491
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:24,072
Father, thousands will die.

492
00:19:24,106 --> 00:19:25,908
You don't understand.

493
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:31,179
"Blessed be the Lord, my strength,

494
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,014
"which teacheth my hands to war,

495
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:36,151
and my fingers to fight."

496
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:37,986
I prayed for His guidance,

497
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,023
and He spoke to me in
a glorious waking dream.

498
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,025
He said that I would
claim victory at Calais!

499
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,861
Son, be happy with me!

500
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,364
Thanks to your father,

501
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,600
you are going to rule half of Europe!

502
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,972
(sighs)

503
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:00,842
(exhales)

504
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:06,033
Francis?

505
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,668
What's the matter? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

506
00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:09,202
I have.

507
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:10,637
It's Father; he's gone utterly mad.

508
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:13,239
Define "utterly," because this is a man

509
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:15,341
who's ridden a pig through the throne room

510
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,810
in nothing but his under things.

511
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,511
Mother, he is starting a war.

512
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:20,180
- What?
- He's attacking Calais.

513
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:21,581
(chuckles) Oh, Francis.

514
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:23,416
Your father, is that what he told you?

515
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,985
- It's all over his maps.
- Darling, relax.

516
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:28,721
I've taken General
Laval into my confidence.

517
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,990
He knows to do nothing without my approval.

518
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,925
General Laval has been dismissed.

519
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,227
Brantome's in charge now.

520
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:36,528
Who's Brantome?

521
00:20:36,563 --> 00:20:39,431
Oh, yes, I forgot.

522
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,400
He's the new one Henry brought it

523
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:44,904
to replace Laval when he
refused to rename the Fifth Army

524
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:47,940
"God's Gauls."

525
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:50,042
Don't worry, Brantome's with us.

526
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:54,613
All of these dismissed generals.

527
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:57,216
I'm beginning to guess how
Mary's uncle knows so much.

528
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,818
What will you do when Father realizes

529
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:01,319
your contravening all his orders?

530
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:03,054
Tomorrow he'll be invading the Spanish.

531
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,722
The next day the Dutch.

532
00:21:04,756 --> 00:21:06,324
When he starts remembering
who he invaded yesterday,

533
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:09,427
perhaps his wits will have returned,

534
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:11,008
and this whole nightmare will be over.

535
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,544
Darling, relax.

536
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,713
If I left things to chance,

537
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:18,516
we'd still be bowing to Queen Penelope.

538
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,117
I promise,

539
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:21,919
it's under control.

540
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:24,621
For France's sake, I hope you're right.

541
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:26,156
(panting)

542
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:28,859
No. Not yet.

543
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:30,260
(gasps)

544
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,494
(laughter)

545
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:36,399
You know, we can stop all this.

546
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:39,903
It worked. I've forgotten all about...

547
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:41,938
You see, I can't even remember
what his name is anymore.

548
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:44,107
(chuckles) Good.

549
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:46,543
There's still more that
I want you to forget.

550
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:48,811
Oh, in that case, I'll
forget that you told me

551
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:51,581
not to take off my skirt.

552
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:53,116
That's not what I mean.

553
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,585
I want you to forget...

554
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,821
every boy who ever smiled at you.

555
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:02,959
Every man who ever flirted with you.

556
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:05,228
Everyone but me.

557
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,565
CHRISTIAN: Were the guards necessary?

558
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,500
Surely a messenger would have sufficed.

559
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,736
I wanted to speak to you
alone, away from your men.

560
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,837
But not away from your men, I see.

561
00:22:15,872 --> 00:22:18,641
Have you spoken with your father?

562
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,976
The king will not agree
to the position you want.

563
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,244
You never asked him, did you?

564
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,812
We both know it was a fool's errand.

565
00:22:23,846 --> 00:22:25,914
There is something else
that you want from me.

566
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:27,683
Are you going to tell me,

567
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:29,918
or am I meant to guess?

568
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,855
Wise men

569
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,190
look to the future.

570
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:36,758
They're patient.

571
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:39,027
When I started to build
my army a decade ago,

572
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:41,129
other men saw a ragtag rabble.

573
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:43,031
I saw what it would become:

574
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:45,267
a bargaining chip

575
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:46,934
that would one day bring kings to me,

576
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:48,936
begging for favors.

577
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,107
You never expected to be
Father's Lord Magistrate.

578
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:56,377
You want to be mine, when I'm king,

579
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:58,780
even if you have to be patient.

580
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:01,349
I won't have to be patient
for long, I don't think.

581
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:04,584
Is it poison, I wonder,
that is driving him mad?

582
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:09,290
I don't trust you

583
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:10,691
and I don't like you.

584
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:12,626
Well, being liked is a king's job,

585
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,228
not his lieutenant's.

586
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,498
Everything in me says I should say no.

587
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,701
And yet you are here...

588
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:22,969
away from your wife.

589
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:26,039
I think you knew you might have to say yes,

590
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,108
and she would object.

591
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:29,756
She would pay any price to save Scotland,

592
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,225
but would never ask you to.

593
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,094
She knows how your family feels about me.

594
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:36,796
Well, you've just explained
to me why I love her.

595
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:39,733
Enough to have her locked
in a tower, I've heard.

596
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,202
Do you want this position or don't you?

597
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:44,804
I want the chance to serve a great ruler.

598
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,207
Great rulers aren't afraid of the truth,

599
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,275
no matter how painful.

600
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,644
The truth is, you love your wife.

601
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:53,546
The truth is,

602
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,483
she needs me.

603
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,685
So what will it be...

604
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,122
my prince?

605
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:05,090
When I am king,

606
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,425
the position is yours.

607
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:11,396
But I have one condition.

608
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,798
Your men will report to me

609
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:14,233
as they would to you.

610
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,400
But why would you need my men to...

611
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,269
I'm going with you to Scotland.

612
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:18,570
Well, that's unwise.

613
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:19,972
And if you die,

614
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:21,807
your promise to me is worth nothing.

615
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:25,610
Well, then, I suggest you keep me alive.

616
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,916
MARY: Are you serious?

617
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,652
My uncle agreed?

618
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:35,119
He'll send enough men to Scotland

619
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,655
to quell the rebellion and save my mother?

620
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:38,089
Yes.

621
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:39,424
I'd almost lost all hope.

622
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,760
Francis, how did you manage it?

623
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,161
I convinced the duke

624
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,296
that it was in his best interests.

625
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,131
I'll explain when I'm back.

626
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,365
Back?

627
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,733
Back from where?

628
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:52,770
I am going with him to Scotland.

629
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,105
What?

630
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,339
Francis, no.

631
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:57,341
Mary, I have to.

632
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,343
It's the only way that I can
assure your mother's safety.

633
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:00,977
And what of your safety?

634
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:03,280
Well, the duke gets
nothing if I don't survive.

635
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:04,682
With a man like that,

636
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:06,617
I can't imagine a better guarantee.

637
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:09,653
Francis, I... I don't know what to say.

638
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:12,656
You're saving my country, my mother,

639
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,124
and you're risking your
life into the bargain.

640
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:17,360
You needn't say anything.

641
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,896
I've only kept my promise.

642
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:22,299
As a king and a husband.

643
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,169
You've done so much more than that.

644
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:58,267
♪ Gave you a minute ♪

645

650
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:15,550
I'm not complaining, but...

651
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:17,252
I thought you wanted to take things slowly.

652
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:18,453
Not anymore.

653
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:20,121
Oh!

00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:26,361
(both moaning)

657
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:29,497
♪ But it was all in your head. ♪

658
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,440
<i>CATHERINE: I'm here now. Out with it.</i>

659
00:26:36,176 --> 00:26:37,511
There was never a baby.

660
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,479
That took less time than I thought.

661
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,749
Please can I keep working
here in the castle?

662
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:44,150
I'll empty chamber pots,

663
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:45,385
I'll muck stalls, anything.

664
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,686
Oh, stop groveling.

665
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,188
As much as it warms me to hear it.

666
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:51,257
I may have other uses for you.

667
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,526
- Other uses?
- I have ladies...

668
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,028
technically, they're my friends,

669
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:56,996
none of whom I trust.

670
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,765
Because they're women who
sleep with men for a cause.

671
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,901
Much like you did with the king.

672
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:04,170
Only it would be my cause.

673
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:07,907
I promise you'll enjoy it more
than emptying chamber pots.

674
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:11,043
I'm gonna send you to
a lady I know in Italy.

675
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:15,414
You'll be taught proper manners,
and the art of deception.

676
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:16,949
And if you work hard,

677
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,384
you may be welcomed back in the castle

678
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,720
as a member of my Flying Squad.

679
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:24,856
This is where you thank me.

680
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,691
Thank you, Your Majesty.

681
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:28,060
Uh...

682
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,865
That will need fixing, too.

683
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:38,703
My family has owned successful
mines for generations,

684
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:41,072
and I'd always hoped to
pass that expertise on

685
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:43,107
to my son, but unfortunately,

686
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,743
I've had only daughters. (chuckles)

687
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,646
Take the Dumfries mine...

688
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:51,315
it's returned 20 tons of
copper a week for years.

689
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,651
A perfect investment for
a man such as yourself.

690
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:55,219
GREER: Lord Castleroy does quite well

691
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,721
in the spice industry,
Father. Why would he want

692
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:00,224
- to invest in mines all the way over in Scotland?
- (Robert chuckles)

693
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:01,825
You can't want me to
waste Lord Castleroy's time

694
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:03,827
explaining things that are
beyond your intelligence.

695
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:05,662
Do I have it wrong?

696
00:28:05,697 --> 00:28:07,598
I think you do, sir.

697
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,567
Quite wrong. I think you forget

698
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:12,268
you're no longer simply
addressing your daughter,

699
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:14,304
<i>but my future wife.</i>

700
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:18,141
And I'm sorry to say that's
not your first mistake.

701
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:20,577
I've done research on your mines,

702
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:22,980
and... Dumfries...

703
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:25,148
has been played out for years.

704
00:28:25,182 --> 00:28:27,450
Much like the rest of your holdings.

705
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:30,686
Now, let's look at some different figures.

706
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:34,090
As part of our marriage settlement,

707
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,126
I will provide 10,000 francs

708
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,329
to each of Greer's sisters to
be used as their future dowries.

709
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:40,863
This will allow your daughters

710
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:43,699
to marry men of title and fortune,

711
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:47,169
making you and your family wealthy.

712
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:50,472
<i>That is what you want... isn't it?</i>

713
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:51,941
Uh...

714
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:53,509
There is just one condition.

715
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:55,344
Greer will have final approval

716
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:57,279
over her sisters' marriages,

717
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:59,715
so she can see to it that
they marry men they love,

718
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,451
not those forced on them.

719
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:05,254
(Robert stammers softly)

720
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:10,192
Uh, why are you doing this?

721
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:13,828
A good businessman always
knows what something is worth.

722
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:15,764
And to me...

723
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,400
Greer is priceless.

724
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:28,209
I never meant for you to go to war for me.

725
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:31,245
When are you going to
realize that I love you,

726
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,447
and I'll do anything for you?

727
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,552
Darling, let me be grateful
for what you've done

728
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:40,020
without making promises you can't keep.

729
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:43,357
What you did was extraordinary.

730
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:47,195
I think maybe when I return,

731
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:49,830
you won't be the only one waiting for me.

732
00:29:49,864 --> 00:29:52,900
You're suddenly very sure of yourself.

733
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,868
I am.

734
00:29:54,903 --> 00:29:57,370
But just to be safe.

735
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,054
(passionate moaning)

736
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:17,224
(exhales)

737
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:20,727
Look at me.

738
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:23,263
Am I the only one in this
bed with something to forget?

739
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,697
What do you mean?

740
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,768
When you're with me,

741
00:30:28,802 --> 00:30:32,071
I want to be the only one inside your head.

742
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:34,273
I want you to look

743
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,809
into my eyes and see only me.

744
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:41,046
I want you to always

745
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,914
remember what I feel like.

746
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:46,818
So when you're using your
fingers for some other task,

747
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:48,887
you wish they were touching me instead.

748
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:51,123
I will.

749
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,158
I want you to always remember

750
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:55,728
what it feels like to be with your wife.

751
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:58,230
♪

752
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:20,652
Ah, my wife and my son.

753
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:23,288
Closest family I have in this world.

754
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:26,023
Sharing my castle, my blood, my legacy.

755
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:27,858
Why would you lie to me?

756
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:29,494
What do you mean?

757
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:31,195
Don't bother adding more lies to the pile.

758
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:32,629
I know what you've done.

759
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:34,364
You've kept me caged up in this place

760
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,033
like one of your song birds.

761
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:39,536
Sending in generals to humor me.

762
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,971
Don't blame Mother when you've been

763
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:43,373
hatching plans to attack half of Europe.

764
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:45,642
They aren't plans anymore!

765
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:48,044
French forces marched
for Calais this morning.

766
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,680
They're already halfway there.

767
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:51,214
You think I'm delusional?

768
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:52,849
Read these dispatches.

769
00:31:52,883 --> 00:31:55,985
They aren't from any of your

770
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,554
performing generals.

771
00:31:57,588 --> 00:31:59,323
What happened to General Brantome?

772
00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:00,524
I've sacked them all.

773
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:02,693
We don't need any generals.

774
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:03,827
Not when we have a king to lead our men.

775
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:04,828
I leave tonight

776
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:07,330
to join the invasion.

777
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:15,238
Oh, dear.

778
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:18,007
No trousers.

779
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:20,743
This keeps happening.

780
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:24,046
I realize now that you two

781
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,848
were only trying to protect me.

782
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:27,717
Guarding my legacy.

783
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:30,586
But that's my job, not yours.

784
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,255
I will not be remembered as King Henry,

785
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,424
ruler who dreamed of conquest.

786
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:39,161
I'll be remembered as
King Henry, conqueror.

787
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:41,496
Greatest military strategist

788
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,065
since Hannibal.

789
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:46,001
Henry, darling, you're not well.

790
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:47,336
I have headaches.

791
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,370
You know what else I have?

792
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:49,537
The backing

793
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:51,073
of God.

794
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:52,907
Francis, please, talk

795
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:54,509
some sense into your father.

796
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:55,943
It's too late.

797
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:57,512
We can't stop the invasion.

798
00:32:57,546 --> 00:32:59,213
And anyway,

799
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:00,849
Father's right.

800
00:33:00,883 --> 00:33:02,250
What?

801
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:05,387
We can take Calais.

802
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:07,756
Any fool knows he can't do that.

803
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,057
It's true, Father's army
would fail on its own.

804
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:13,460
But two armies.

805
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:15,529
One marching head on.

806
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:18,232
The other across this frozen marsh,

807
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,101
flanking the English from behind.

808
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:22,203
Do you mean the duke's army? Mary's army?

809
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:25,539
Mary will have to understand.

810
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,974
I have no choice.

811
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:29,576
I need

812
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:33,046
the duke's army to save France.

813
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,048
If we don't win this war, it won't matter

814
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:37,951
what happens with Mary's mother.

815
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:40,821
England will have its way
with both our countries.

816
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:45,125
Father, if I do this,

817
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,893
you have to cooperate.

818
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:49,562
No more dismissing anyone who disagrees.

819
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,731
You will be a conqueror

820
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:54,467
but only if we work together.

821
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:56,803
Can you promise me that?

822
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:58,971
My son,

823
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:02,174
making history with me,

824
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:06,345
just like I've always dreamed.

825
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:17,357
(knocking)

826
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:20,294
(sighs)

827
00:34:20,328 --> 00:34:23,064
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

828
00:34:23,098 --> 00:34:24,965
I hope I wasn't out of line.

829
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
It's my father who should be apologizing,

830
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:27,967
though he never would.

831
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:30,970
No one's ever stood up
for me like that before.

832
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:32,806
- Or for my sisters.
- I was surprised to see

833
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,075
how quiet you acted around your father.

834
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:37,311
I've come to rather
enjoy your usual nature.

835
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,446
Outspoken, bold.

836
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,182
How long have you known the truth about us?

837
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:44,084
I've known for some time.

838
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:45,919
As a businessman, I always do my research.

839
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:49,989
But as a gentleman, I... I
wasn't about to bring it up.

840
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:51,290
And as your future husband,
you should know I'm...

841
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:53,292
Too rich to care.

842
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:55,829
I can't thank you enough.

843
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:57,363
No need to thank me.

844
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:59,998
Everyone deserves the
chance to find happiness.

845
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,701
Just as I have.

846
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:03,669
Which brings me to this,

847
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:06,138
I have something I'd like you to look over.

848
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,674
But promise me you won't sign it

849
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,409
until you're ready.

850
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,851
This is our wedding contract.

851
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,619
Yes, and since you're now

852
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:23,222
in charge of all marriage
contracts for your family,

853
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:27,126
it means nothing without your approval.

854
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,563
♪ And I fell ♪

855
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:40,138
♪ Into a well of hope ♪

856
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,475
Is something wrong?

857
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,644
No, that felt surprisingly right.

858
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:51,515
So you are taking my mother's last hope,

859
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,386
leaving her to the mercy of
thousands of Protestant rebels

860
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,222
demanding her head and my crown.

861
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,991
Mary, please understand.

862
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,226
I do understand.

863
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,262
You're doing what you think
is best for your country.

864
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,096
Not only my country.

865
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,099
If France is beaten at Calais,
your country will suffer, too.

866
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,868
- France can hardly defend Scotland.
- Defend Scotland?

867
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,037
When have you ever defended Scotland?

868
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,906
Except with brave words?

869
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,208
- That is not fair.
- Now you want fair?

870
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,711
We are rulers, not schoolchildren.

871
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,446
Blood will be spilled because
of the choice you have made,

872
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,682
- my mother's blood.
- You don't know that.

873
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,185
- But the blood of thousands would be spilled...
- Yes,

874
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,955
- French blood, I know.
- I do not only think of France!

875
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,726
No, you do not.

876
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,228
But you do put her first.

877
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:41,431
As any king would.

878
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,833
Then can you forgive me?

879
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,302
It is myself

880
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,070
I cannot forgive.

881
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,307
I've made an awful mistake.

882
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,909
Our marriage was an awful mistake.

883
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:54,730
Please don't say that.

884
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:57,108
There were a thousand moments
where I could've done something.

885
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:01,250
Made secret treaties, sold favors,

886
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:03,652
even snuck away to Scotland

887
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:05,821
to be with those people who need me.

888
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,657
And do you know why I didn't?

889
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:10,559
Because I love you.

890
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:12,927
Because I am your wife.

891
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,230
Mary, listen, when we have taken Calais,

892
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:17,332
the first thing I will
do is travel to Scotland

893
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,834
with your uncle's army.

894
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:20,836
We can still save your mother.

895
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,604
Like when you promised you would take me

896
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:24,740
to Scotland with my brother? Like when you

897
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:26,341
promised soldiers the time before that

898
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,109
and the time before that?

899
00:37:28,143 --> 00:37:30,611
You make it sound like every
promise I make is an empty one.

900
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:33,248
What other promise can you make?

901
00:37:33,282 --> 00:37:36,251
You are the future king.

902
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,419
It's not that simple.

903
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:39,954
Maybe it should be.

904
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:43,591
For both of us.

905
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,760
What does that mean?

906
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:50,130
Nothing.

907
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:52,299
I don't know.

908
00:37:57,672 --> 00:38:00,807
I'm only going to ask two things of you.

909
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:08,782
The first is that you
stop making me promises

910
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:11,751
you know in your heart you can't keep.

911
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:20,993
And the other?

912
00:38:21,028 --> 00:38:22,629
(sniffles)

913
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:26,165
Come back to me.

914
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:30,036
Live through this battle.

915
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,405
And don't let England cost me you.

916
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:44,350
(trumpeting) Forward!

917
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:47,570
Have faith, Mary. Francis
is clever and strong.

918
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,488
He'll return home safely.

919
00:38:49,522 --> 00:38:52,223
I hope so.

920
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:54,993
But even if he survives,

921
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:57,663
our marriage is...

922
00:38:57,697 --> 00:38:59,565
What?

923
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,568
Francis is trying to save his country,

924
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:04,536
and I can forgive him for that,

925
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:07,339
as I hope he will forgive me

926
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:09,174
for doing what needs
to be done for Scotland,

927
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,675
whatever that may be.

928
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,910
What if he can't forgive you?

929
00:39:12,945 --> 00:39:16,414
Well, that will just be too bad.

930
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:19,417
I won't let him put my
country at risk again.
