<i>Previously on Reign...</i>

8
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:33,651
<i>BASH: It's not what we chose.</i>

9
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:35,453
We're married before king and God.

10
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,322
You're pregnant with my husband's child.

11
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,456
And if Francis finds out...

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,958
I will do my very best to marry.

13
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,715
The beautiful creature standing beside me

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,584
has agreed to be my wife!

15
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,686
- Have you changed your mind?
- I'm pregnant.

16
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,155
You look very pretty.

17
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,456
Perhaps it is time to rejoin society.

18
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,425
I can give you the
pleasure you offer others.

19
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:53,727
These days he seems infatuated by Penelope.

20
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,529
<i>Barely even notices affairs of state.</i>

21
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,799
You are ill... you could do
harm to yourself, to France.

22
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:02,869
We have waited a long time for you to rise.

23
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:04,738
<i>MARY: If it ever becomes a
choice between our two countries,</i>

24
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,539
I will choose mine.

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,777
What's this?

26
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,012
A wedding ring.

27
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,246
It's modest, I know.

28
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:14,681
It belonged to my grandmother.

29
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:16,116
Huh.

30
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,617
I thought Diane de
Poitiers came from money.

31
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,353
(sighs) Well, if you don't want it...

32
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:21,721
I didn't say that.

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,522
It's just...

34
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,623
well, why?

35
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:26,624
We're married.

36
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:27,825
We can't be un-married.

37
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,594
I thought we'd agreed to at least try.

38
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:30,595
(wry laugh)

39
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:31,762
How romantic.

40
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:33,764
Yes, let's...

41
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:35,566
try.

42
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:39,636
Well, there's a promising start.

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,841
They've spared no expense
for Lola's wedding.

44
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,643
Bares no resemblance to mine.

45
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,213
Try not to be bitter on Lola's special day.

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,081
Kenna, Greer, I found you!

47
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,183
Look at this necklace Julien just gave me.

48
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,884
KENNA: Well, now I am bitter.

49
00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:56,853
Those sapphires are the size of grapes.

50
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:58,154
It's gorgeous.

51
00:01:58,222 --> 00:01:59,856
But why are you talking to Julien

52
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,991
before your wedding? And
why aren't you dressed?

53
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:02,993
The ceremony's in less than an hour.

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,494
Wish me luck. And happiness.

55
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:06,262
With all of our hearts.

56
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,499
I think they have a chance.

57
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,834
She seems so hopeful and excited.

58
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,068
You're next.

59
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,037
Once Castleroy returns from his business.

60
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:16,439
We haven't set a date yet.

61
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:18,741
You might as well as it's inevitable.

62
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,909
Your reputation can't do
with a broken engagement.

63
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,445
Thank you for the reminder.

64
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,447
At least Castleroy's title is real.

65
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:26,949
Well, the Master of Horse and Hunt

66
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,550
may not have any lands but...

67
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,886
at least Bash is young and handsome.

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,055
I suppose he is, isn't he?

69
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:35,124
How are things between you two?

70
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,692
I don't know.

71
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:37,693
I can sense that he's trying.

72
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,194
But the fact that he has to...

73
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:41,697
imagine how awful our
wedding was, how monstrous...

74
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,066
HENRY: Lady Kenna?

75
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,936
Your Grace.

76
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,872
I can see by your dress

77
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,541
that you're still trying to...

78
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:53,875
impress your king.

79
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:58,613
It's working.

80
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,917
(grunts)

81
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:08,422
Don't hide yourself away.

82
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,491
Or I'll have to come find you.

83
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:14,495
This...

84
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,697
itches.

85
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:26,273
How is this marriage ever going to work?

86
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,186
Oh.

87
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,321
Oh, dear. Did I step on your toes?

88
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,289
Are those tears of pain?

89
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,290
No.

90
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,426
I'm just so grateful.

91
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,961
You're too good to me.

92
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,362
Do go on, wife.

93
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,431
This day, this necklace,

94
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:55,034
marrying me, even in my situation.

95
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,302
No more of that talk.

96
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,639
I've only given you what you deserve.

97
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,974
From now on, we're in this together.

98
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,876
No secrets, no shame.

99
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,111
Just the two of us

100
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,179
on the adventure of our lives.

101
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,350
(laughing)

102
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,278
FRANCIS: Pleased to see
you enjoying yourself.

103
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:18,480
It wasn't so long ago you were ready

104
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,415
to rain anarchy down on this place.

105
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,885
It wasn't so long ago that
your parents were trying

106
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,953
to trick me into bequeathing them Scotland.

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,121
That's enough merriment for you two.

108
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:29,658
We have problems.

109
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:32,427
Well, then.

110
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,437
Mother, what's so wrong that it can't wait

111
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:35,805
the length of a dance?

112
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:38,174
That impatient-looking man over there

113
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:40,243
is Cardinal Morosini, the Pope's new envoy.

114
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,445
Don't look now.

115
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,813
I thought the cardinal
wasn't due for another week.

116
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,649
The weather cleared in the
Alps, and he left early.

117
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,419
He came all this way to see Henry.

118
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:52,755
But your father seems to
have chosen not to attend.

119
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,490
Well, maybe that's a blessing,

120
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:57,292
seeing how Father is feeling.

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,094
Can't the cardinal be told
that the king's indisposed?

122
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:01,163
For an entire week?

123
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,999
That's how long the cardinal is staying.

124
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,935
He wants to renegotiate leases

125
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:07,369
on the Pope's tenancies in France.

126
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,672
We depend on that income.

127
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:12,507
FRANCIS: Can't you negotiate with him?

128
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,342
Let's just say that the
cardinal wasn't my choice

129
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,778
for his current position,
and he's well aware of it.

130
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:18,346
There might be another way.

131
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,115
I have an idea.

132
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,488
I'm not sure about this.

133
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:27,855
Trust me.

134
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:29,291
Just follow my lead.

135
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:31,325
Cardinal Morosini, what an honor

136
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:32,627
and a pleasure to meet you.

137
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:34,963
Your Grace, a pleasure indeed.

138
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,664
Dauphin.

139
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,467
You'll forgive our presumptions.

140
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,569
We thought you might agree,

141
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:43,471
as Francis and I are the
future of France and Scotland,

142
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,973
and you are the future of Rome,

143
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:48,075
that we might discuss the, uh, um...

144
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,710
how should I say it?

145
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:52,379
The intimacies of our Papal relations?

146
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:54,715
I'm not sure what you mean.

147
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:56,650
Well, you're here to discuss
rents and tenancies, yes?

148
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,320
With King Henry, indeed.

149
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:03,323
I'm sure Henry will sign off
on anything that we agree on.

150
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:05,692
Tell me, are cardinals permitted to dance?

151
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:08,328
To further the interests of Rome,

152
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:09,329
why not?

153
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:12,933
Then let us go further.

154
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,268
(clears throat)

155
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,070
Have you learned anything?

156
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,538
Where is Henry?

157
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:19,905
Queen Penelope told me

158
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,374
to tell you that the king is quite

159
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,476
tied up.

160
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,181
Oh, Good Lord.

161
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,782
(sighs)

162
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,203
Where is Penelope?

163
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,771
She's gone to get supplies.

164
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:36,207
The waiting is horrible.

165
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,274
I love it.

166
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,275
Henry...

167
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:39,944
that girl is humiliating us.

168
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,747
She's a thief. She's looting the castle.

169
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,782
There are rumors that you have gifted her

170
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,550
an entire estate.

171
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:48,052
She deserves it.

172
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:52,822
People are talking about your behavior.

173
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,491
Her control over you.

174
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,260
Rumors could reach the Vatican.

175
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:59,129
Is the cardinal already here?

176
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,064
You've had your fun with the girl.

177
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:02,198
But it has to stop.

178
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:03,533
Now.

179
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:06,836
I will not be so demeaned by a woman!

180
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,005
Yes, I can see that.

181
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,343
Your Grace, I've come to announce

182
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:17,313
the arrival of James
Stewart, Earl of Moray.

183
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,184
My lord Earl of Moray.

184
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,551
Why are you still on your knees?

185
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,988
Your Grace, I always kneel before my queen.

186
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,457
Please, stand up. I am also your sister.

187
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,626
Half sister.

188
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:32,495
Oh, James, you've grown a beard.

189
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:33,929
It suits you.

190
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:37,700
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming?

191
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,268
There was no time.

192
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:41,504
Your mother, Marie de Guise, is in trouble.

193
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,838
And she needs your help.

194
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:45,507
Yes, we fund her troubles.

195
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,442
Mary, this is real.

196
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,378
And the French help you sent
hasn't proved a solution.

197
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:51,880
It's rather the problem.

198
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:53,415
Well, I don't understand.

199
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,250
Your mother is French, and so are

200
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:57,019
half the men she has
running Scotland's affairs.

201
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:59,020
Scots want their affairs managed

202
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,122
by men who share their nationality.

203
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:03,358
And they want it more
passionately every day.

204
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,860
And why hasn't my mother
attended to this problem?

205
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,929
I'm not sure she sees it or cares.

206
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,698
Scots are a crude people to her.

207
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,866
In need of French leadership.

208
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:14,536
You have always resented my mother.

209
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:16,304
But she serves me.

210
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,271
Are you sure

211
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:22,276
it is not me that you truly resent?

212
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,578
Are you sure it's not my
rule you wish to change?

213
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:27,215
If it were, do you think

214
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,883
I'd have come here to tip my hand?

215
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,918
Then why are you here?

216
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:33,454
Do you want me to tell my
mother to bring more Scots

217
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:35,255
- into her government?
- One will do.

218
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,657
For the moment.

219
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,124
Who? You?

220
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,626
You.

221
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:42,763
Scotland needs to see her queen.

222
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:43,997
To bow before her as I do,

223
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,267
with pride and with duty.

224
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,169
Come home to Scotland.

225
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,338
Come home.

226
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,821
Now? You want to go to Scotland now?

227
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,655
James says it's now or never.

228
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,390
The Scots feel occupied

229
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:04,093
by their French allies.
If we don't act now,

230
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,928
they could end up hating you
more than they hate the English.

231
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,896
It needs attention, I can see that.

232
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,933
But why does it need
your attention in person?

233
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,302
So they can see that they
still have a Scottish queen.

234
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:15,738
So I can strengthen my mother's rule.

235
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,740
And then, if that doesn't
work, then to replace her,

236
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,074
with someone who can rule for me.

237
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,276
Well, then let me send diplomats.

238
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,677
Let me help you determine the answers

239
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:25,080
without sending you into
the middle of so much unrest.

240
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:26,348
More Frenchmen?

241
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,016
To solve the problem of not enough Scots?

242
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,452
Mary, you convinced the cardinal

243
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,320
to do business with us.

244
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:33,955
You can't leave in the middle
of what you just started.

245
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,323
Then finish it without me.

246
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,958
I told him we were the future

247
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,192
of Scotland and France,

248
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,761
you and I both.

249
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:41,329
You know perfectly well
why he doesn't insist

250
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,597
on meeting with Father.

251
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,931
He keeps asking for you.

252
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:44,932
He wants more of your flirting,

253
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,033
your innuendos.

254
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,503
You want me to risk

255
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,139
Scotland's health to continue some game?

256
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,641
To save France some embarrassment?

257
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,376
My father is mad.

258
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,448
France is unstable enough as it is.

259
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,885
If word gets out of his madness,

260
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,821
if Rome pulls its support and its money,

261
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:10,658
this country could come apart.

262
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,860
Mary, I promise I will
travel to Scotland with you.

263
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,296
Just not now.

264
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,164
Please wait until this deal is sealed

265
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:19,132
and my father is better.

266
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,635
Don't you see? I need you here

267
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,370
with me, safe by my side,

268
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:27,007
while France is in peril,

269
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,508
and whilst we're trying to have a child.

270
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:31,511
An heir.

271
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,846
For France, of course.

272
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:36,316
Stability... for France.

273
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:39,852
A handy queen consort for the pleasure

274
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,555
of the next king... of France.

275
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,791
I don't just think of my country's needs.

276
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:47,159
I think of my wife's needs
as well, but Scotland...

277
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,028
Is one and the same.

278
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:52,031
My country and I are one and the same.

279
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:55,301
Forget that, and you've forgotten who I am.

280
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,943
How are you... wife?

281
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,178
Perfect... husband.

282
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:07,847
You?

283
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,385
Husband and wife.

284
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:15,253
A family.

285
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:16,955
Two families, really.

286
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,790
Who'll have to meet, at some point,

287
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:22,060
since the wedding was so quick.

288
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,528
Tell me about your parents.

289
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,130
After breakfast, hmm?

290
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:28,216
I'm famished.

291
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:31,171
Julien, let's leave on our wedding tour

292
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:32,806
as soon as possible, can we?

293
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,307
Before I really begin to show.

294
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:36,575
Are you quite sure it's
safe for you to travel?

295
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,978
I thought maybe we ought
to remain here a bit

296
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:41,147
till everything's settled.

297
00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:42,515
What needs to be settled?

298
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,650
I don't know.

299
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,251
Living arrangements, paperwork...

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,520
your dowry.

301
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:49,555
My dowry?

302
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,824
Why wait on that?

303
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:54,327
Because, otherwise, it
could be months of delay.

304
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:56,028
So what?

305
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:59,264
We're both rich.

306
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,367
The money will follow
us wherever we settle.

307
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,768
Right. Of course you're right.

308
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:09,241
So tell me,

309
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,377
where would you like to go on our tour?

310
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:21,553
I admire your disregard
for others' opinions,

311
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:24,021
but we have to consider how this looks.

312
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:26,090
You've been staying with me.

313
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,459
People will talk.

314
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:32,430
You saved me, Nostradamus.

315
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,233
If people want to talk, let them say that.

316
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:16,572
Lady Kenna.

317
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:21,511
You distract me so.

318
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:25,114
What is it, hmm?

319
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:28,017
Um, perhaps my new ring?

320
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,787
A wedding gift from my husband.

321
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:31,788
Your son.

322
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,155
Oh. Mm.

323
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:35,024
PENELOPE: Oh, it's lovely.

324
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,659
I want it.

325
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,028
Henry.

326
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:43,598
Henry, I'm your queen.

327
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,067
And it's so cute and tiny.

328
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:49,371
(clears throat)

329
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,474
A compliment to your fine tastes.

330
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,977
It's not right. I won't have it.

331
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,613
(clears throat)

332
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,050
Catherine.

333
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,653
Lady Kenna seems to need a wedding ring.

334
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:05,654
Pardon?

335
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,756
A ring, Catherine.

336
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,892
Here.

337
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,193
Wonderful.

338
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,128
Wear it in good health.

339
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,206
You shouldn't have to live like this.

340
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,541
True. But I'd also like you to live.

341
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,743
I'm too high-spirited to be a widow.

342
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,011
People will talk.

343
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:32,980
Please.

344
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,348
You'll only make it worse.

345
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,249
He's moved on now. Go get some air.

346
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:39,119
I'm all right.

347
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,723
Keep it.

348
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,793
A token of my sympathy.

349
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,030
Henry is not himself,

350
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,333
and that woman is making life untenable,

351
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,602
not only for us but for all of France.

352
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:57,004
For France?

353
00:14:57,038 --> 00:15:00,607
The irony is, if Henry knew how close

354
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,009
he was to exposing himself

355
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,610
to his precious Vatican friends...

356
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:05,211
What are you talking about?

357
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:07,514
A plan to get rid of her.

358
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,616
I need your help to get rid of Penelope.

359
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,751
You mean, to kill her?

360
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,186
I wouldn't come to you
if it were that simple.

361
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:16,055
Henry would suspect me; he'd have my head.

362
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,124
I don't need to be part
of any of your schemes.

363
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,392
Oh, you do,

364
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,926
for so many reasons,

365
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,029
but I'll give you one
that will appeal to you.

366
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:27,366
Help me, and I'll help you and Sebastian...

367
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:31,870
an estate of your own,
far from French court.

368
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:36,775
But it's more than just
land: it's a chance for you

369
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,944
and your husband to live life free

370
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:41,279
from the constant threat
of Henry taking it all away.

371
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:42,915
But why me?

372
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,717
Would your plan just throw
me back into bed with him?

373
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:48,720
Not at all.

374
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:51,456
But it does involve sex.

375
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,658
And rather a mess of it.

376
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,873
(both grunting)

377
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,448
Sorry, I'm a bit spent.

378
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,683
You're hundreds of miles away.

379
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,053
Scotland, I'm guessing?

380
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,155
Some dire news brought
by Mary's brother James?

381
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:16,357
He's convinced her she's
needed in Scotland right away.

382
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:18,959
From the moment that I
started to fall for her,

383
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,694
this is what I feared most:

384
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:23,163
that, someday, the needs of our
countries would tear us apart.

385
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,066
Wouldn't have mattered,
except you married for love.

386
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,735
I wanted to believe that we
could push past these problems,

387
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,804
- work together.
- And can't you?

388
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:32,706
Mostly, yes. But what happens
when being a good king means

389
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,006
being a bad husband?

390
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:37,043
That's simple: be a bad king.

391
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,512
That's why she wanted
to marry you, isn't it?

392
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,215
She never wanted to marry me.

393
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,749
She wanted to save your life.

394
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:46,553
Come on, you're smarter
than that, and so is she.

395
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,254
Mary knew that you could
promise her something

396
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:51,691
that I never could, something
that I warned her from the start.

397
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:54,894
You could put her first, always.

398
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:57,362
Isn't that what love is?

399
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,999
To anyone but a king.

400
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,209
Perhaps one of the original gems was lost

401
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,377
and had to be replaced with a fake.

402
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,079
Why not mention it to Julien?

403
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,148
He'll probably just
have it repaired for you.

404
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,249
I don't want to stir up mistrust.

405
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,583
It seems like mistrust

406
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,318
is already stirred up. What happened?

407
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,155
Whenever I mention meeting his parents

408
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,690
or going to Hungary on our wedding
tour, he changes the subject.

409
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,992
Plenty of people would
like to hide their parents.

410
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,561
Me, for instance.

411
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,164
It's also the subjects
he does seem keen on...

412
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,499
like my dowry.

413
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,201
Well, it is a large sum.

414
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,738
For a rich man with a castle in Hungary,

415
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,839
he seems awfully impatient
to have it in hand.

416
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,340
What did your family tell you about him?

417
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:58,909
Just that he was a very wealthy Hungarian

418
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:02,112
who married two rich women.

419
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,515
Both wives died, making
him sad, but even richer.

420
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,350
And there was nothing
suspect about his finances?

421
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,219
He gambled a bit, but all men do.

422
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,888
Besides, you can't gamble
away wealth like his.

423
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,189
My brother came awfully close.

424
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,258
Talk to Julien.

425
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,560
You've both been so open till now.

426
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,195
Well, yes and no.

427
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:21,798
When I told him I was
pregnant but wouldn't say

428
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:24,301
who the father was, he said he wouldn't ask

429
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,770
about my past mistakes
if I didn't ask about his.

430
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:31,407
I'm sure he meant nothing more
than the usual male adventuring.

431
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,709
You wed quickly is all. It's nerves, Lola.

432
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:35,878
I'm sure of it.

433
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,450
Trinidad?

434
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:42,785
Really?

435
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,886
That seems awfully far.

436
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,322
Far from everything.

437
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:48,490
Olivia wants to find a new life with me.

438
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,494
You'd be taking her from
all the comforts of court.

439
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,863
She's been through so much here.

440
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:55,997
We both have.

441
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:57,666
The years have been long and dark.

442
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:03,138
I'm thankful for the time
I spent as your adviser,

443
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,440
but I... I want to give her a new start.

444
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:07,909
You're trying to save her.

445
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,578
You've seen danger here.

446
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:14,916
My old friend, how can I say this?

447
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:17,986
I can't let you leave.

448
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:21,656
Your gift of sight is invaluable to me,

449
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,524
to the safety of France.

450
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,061
You can force me to stay...

451
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:32,099
but not to see.

452
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,634
You'll have me, but not my visions.

453
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:35,836
Not if you cost me this
last chance at happiness.

454
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:38,372
So you came to me as if I had a choice,

455
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,277
- but clearly I don't.
- You have choices.

456
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:42,249
And none will get you
what you want from me.

457
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:43,317
I could take your life.

458
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,286
This is not a betrayal.

459
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:49,156
This is a friend saying good-bye.

460
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:55,595
I suppose I'll have to wish you luck, then.

461
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,564
You'll need it, you know.

462
00:19:57,632 --> 00:20:02,068
If you think you're safe in
the New World, you're wrong.

463
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:06,039
The land is soft and sweet,
but filled with vipers.

464
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,776
(door opens)

465
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,314
I've been thinking,

466
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,615
and I want to take you to Scotland with me.

467
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,452
Yes, I know, you told me that. But when?

468
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,786
Next month?

469
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,456
- Next year?
- Now.

470
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,858
As soon as we can.

471
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,210
It will need to be brief,

472
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:30,813
and I'll need to finish
my deal with the cardinal

473
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,282
before we leave, and make sure

474
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,551
that my mother can handle my father.

475
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:38,086
It won't be easy, may take a day or two.

476
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,322
You're serious.

477
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:43,959
But what if we can't seal
the deal with the Vatican?

478
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,894
What if your father gets worse? What... ?

479
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,797
What if my wife doesn't
realize that I love her?

480
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:52,134
What if she doesn't see
that I've put her first?

481
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:54,903
Francis, thank you.

482
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:58,473
I promise you'll be glad we went.

483
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,942
When Scotland is stronger,
France will be stronger, too.

484
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,677
Well, start packing.

485
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:04,111
And tell your brother

486
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:06,080
that Scotland will soon greet her queen

487
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:07,949
and her king.

488
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:11,031
Both of you? Really?

489
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:13,333
I thought you'd be pleased.

490
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:15,335
You wanted a queen for Scotland to bow to,

491
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,504
and now you're getting
more: a queen and a king.

492
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,772
A French king.

493
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:20,006
My king.

494
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,541
Scotland's king.

495
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,509
Who arrives with French soldiers,

496
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:25,145
who even has "France" in his name.

497
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:26,379
James, this is silly.

498
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,181
Francis is strong

499
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:30,483
and he's devoted to me and to Scotland.

500
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,552
When Scotland sees that with her own eyes,

501
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:34,154
the crown will be stronger

502
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:35,689
and so will my mother's position.

503
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:37,456
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

504
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:39,124
Of course.

505
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,360
I apologize.

506
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:43,529
I worry too much.

507
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:45,964
Scotland will celebrate her queen,

508
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:49,402
even if she arrives with some
fair-haired French baggage.

509
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:52,004
(laughs) How soon can you leave?

510
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:53,573
Uh, Francis has some business to attend to,

511
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:54,973
and then we'll leave.

512
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:58,510
I'll make arrangements immediately.

513
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:03,982
You seem worried, my darling.

514
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,417
Are you having doubts?

515
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:06,418
No.

516
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,253
I'm eager to go.

517
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,988
I've considered it for some time.

518
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:11,389
I've made mistakes.

519
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:13,625
I've misread prophecies

520
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,993
and shared others where
I probably shouldn't have.

521
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,229
Sooner or later,

522
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:19,464
the truth will catch up to me.

523
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:21,600
Leaving is the right thing,

524
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:22,934
for both of us.

525
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,203
I want you to know,

526
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,338
whatever happens,

527
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:29,040
you've already...

528
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:30,208
Olivia!

529
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:31,342
Oh!

530
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,718
Beware of vipers.

531
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:43,954
She's beautiful,

532
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,689
but damnably willful and headstrong.

533
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:47,358
And there's something not right

534
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:49,593
about someone else telling
me who to spend my life with.

535
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,262
Not to mention she's been
with a member of my own family.

536
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,730
Uh, forgive my lack of compassion,

537
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,231
but I'm not sure whether you're bemoaning

538
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:55,633
your situation with
Kenna or mine with Mary.

539
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,833
(laughter in distance)

540
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,738
(coins clinking)

541
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,307
(indistinct conversation)

542
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,243
FRANCIS: That was Mimi Natalia, wasn't it?

543
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,744
BASH: Mary's brother's footman

544
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:10,480
has expensive tastes in courtesans.

545
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:13,549
Suspiciously expensive, I think.

546
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,854
Hmm...

547
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:21,724
It needs more.

548
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,426
More?

549
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:24,960
PENELOPE: More red.

550
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,163
More lace.

551
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,899
To keep the king's eyes from wandering

552
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,001
to, uh, sad old habits.

553
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,502
Yes, Your Grace.

554
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,272
What do you want?

555
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,908
Did you come here for
this miserable little ring?

556
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,177
Not at all. You can keep it.

557
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:42,611
I actually came here to help.

558
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,913
(scoffs)

559
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,147
I find that hard to believe.

560
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,615
Have you noticed that the queen

561
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:48,083
makes no effort to have you removed?

562
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:51,085
She tried and she failed.

563
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,788
She's an artist with poisons.

564
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,155
If she wanted you dead,

565
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,857
you'd be rotting by now.

566
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:57,459
No, you're alive because you serve

567
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:59,661
a purpose: you keep our
poor mad king distracted.

568
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,667
He is unwell, yes.

569
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,870
I try to divert him from his pain.

570
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:06,371
Well, you used to divert him.

571
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,172
Until his mind wandered back

572
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,375
to "sad old habits,"

573
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,377
- like me.
- You won't get him back,

574
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,611
if that's what you're thinking.

575
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,113
I don't want Henry back.

576
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,948
I've seen what he does to playthings,

577
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:18,783
once they start to bore
him, and it's not pretty.

578
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:20,885
What's your point?

579
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,788
If you want to keep the king's interest

580
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:26,390
and survive by his side...

581
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,827
Then again, if you're unconcerned...

582
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:32,062
I'm listening.

583
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:38,068
Have you tried blindfolds?

584
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,803
Having him listen to
the sound of your voice?

585
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,805
His Grace would follow me anywhere.

586
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,873
- Hot wax on his chest?
- Just his chest?

587
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:45,475
(laughs)

588
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:46,776
No wonder he tired of you.

589
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:48,378
The standing cross?

590
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,251
All I did was pay for the lady's services.

591
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,052
Since when is that a crime?

592
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,286
It's rather how much you paid,

593
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:58,755
and how you could afford it.

594
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:01,591
I told you, in thanks
for a decade's service.

595
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,293
Service to my wife's
brother, the Earl of Moray.

596
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:06,463
But he's a Scot, and you're a Scot

597
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:09,999
<i>and there's... a Queen Mary on this coin,</i>

598
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,468
<i>but not my Queen Mary.</i>

599
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,115
That gold isn't mine.

600
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:15,518
You're lying.

601
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:17,453
Not a good start.

602
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:22,858
My men found this gold in your room,

603
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:24,060
stitched into your valise.

604
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,528
Would you care to explain to me

605
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:28,030
why you're carrying English gold?

606
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:29,497
I don't know what you mean.

607
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,266
Where were you going when my men caught you

608
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,668
ducking out of the castle?

609
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:34,169
Meeting the person who paid you this gold?

610
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,403
An Englishman?

611
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:36,738
An enemy of my wife's?

612
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:38,006
No.

613
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:39,441
I... I'm not from these parts.

614
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:42,444
I just wanted to see the village.

615
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:49,551
Fetch the torturer and tell him
that we may have a job for him.

616
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:53,020
I don't want to hurt you, but trust me...

617
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,058
they do.

618
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:04,992
<i>He admitted to having enough
gold to pay for a courtesan,</i>

619
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,460
but denied that the gold
hidden in his own bag was his.

620
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,629
He's lying; he has to be.

621
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:10,878
There are plenty of ways for a Scotsman

622
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,145
to get ahold of English gold.

623
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:14,081
We still trade with the English.

624
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:15,682
Then why so much of it,

625
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,916
and why lie about it?

626
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:18,084
Leave us.

627
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,855
This is my brother's footman

628
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:23,089
- you are torturing.
- Questioning.

629
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,892
For now. Which is why
I came straight to you.

630
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,260
Mary, does none of this trouble you?

631
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,262
I trust my brother.

632
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:31,978
This footman could be a
Protestant Scottish rebel,

633
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:34,013
or work for the English, or both.

634
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:35,747
And whether James knows what his own man

635
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:37,316
is up to or not, you aren't safe.

636
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:38,650
James will keep me safe.

637
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:40,419
Are you so sure?

638
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:41,720
James is a Protestant...

639
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,857
He hates the French.

640
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:46,758
And many want to see him rule Scotland.

641
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:49,495
Only one claim to power
is stronger than his,

642
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:52,263
- and that's yours.
- If his claim is so strong,

643
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:54,265
then why doesn't he topple
my mother without warning me?

644
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,301
Why bring me back to make his
task that much more difficult?

645
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:58,770
You're assuming he wanted
to see you home safely.

646
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:01,439
Accidents happen at sea all the time.

647
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:03,174
Then I will ask James about this.

648
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:04,843
And what if he's a part of it?

649
00:27:04,878 --> 00:27:06,878
He'll lie and you'll learn nothing from it.

650
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,679
Mary, don't you need to
know how much you can trust

651
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,215
your own brother?

652
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,850
For the sake of your
mother and for Scotland,

653
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:15,120
give me a little time
to find you some answers.

654
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:16,687
I want to take you to Scotland,

655
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,323
but not if I'm leading us both into danger.

656
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:21,192
Do it quickly.

657
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,793
There's a storm coming.
We need to leave soon.

658
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:25,796
(grunts)

659
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,771
Wait.

660
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,707
I don't know about this.

661
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:39,308
What's wrong? Is the platform unsteady?

662
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:40,410
It's not that.

663
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:41,912
It doesn't feel right.

664
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:43,813
Exactly.

665
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:45,681
It's wrong.

666
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:48,251
You're a wicked old king,

667
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,286
and you need to be cleansed of your sins.

668
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,060
Please.

669
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,294
Take me down.

670
00:27:58,362 --> 00:28:00,096
Kenna said you would beg.

671
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,231
Oh, dear Kenna.

672
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,534
(sighs) How I miss her kind face.

673
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:08,003
Shut up.

674
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,006
(pounding at door)

675
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:13,175
Henry, I'm sorry.

676
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,309
I tried to make him wait.

677
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:16,879
But the rumors...

678
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:19,847
- The bishop insisted on seeing you.
- Bishop?!

679
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:21,616
Don't you remember?

680
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,419
This is Bishop Renauld, from Provence.

681
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,354
He came with the cardinal,
the Pope's delegation.

682
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:27,589
RENAULD: Your Grace.

683
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:29,491
I... I cannot look. This is,

684
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,726
- is blasphemy.
- Then close your eyes,

685
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,361
you pious fool.

686
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,863
I will, but what of God?

687
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:39,867
Oh, don't bring...

688
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:41,335
don't bring Him into this.

689
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,805
But He is here...

690
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:48,309
He is everywhere; He sees this mockery!

691
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,044
If you turn from Him...

692
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:55,583
what if He turns from you?

693
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:57,084
But would He?

694
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,885
It is God's will that puts you here.

695
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,655
It is God's will that
gives you your armies,

696
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,558
your gold, your crown.

697
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,627
He only provides for those

698
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:08,829
who are worthy and righteous.

699
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:10,263
I see no righteousness here.

700
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,498
Henry, end this now.

701
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,233
Send this witch away,

702
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:15,235
- before her wickedness curses us all...
- Wait!

703
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:17,303
They're in it together! Don't you see?

704
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:19,472
Leave, Penelope.

705
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,941
Kenna and the queen...

706
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,144
- Henry, they've got you twisted in knots!
- It is you

707
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:27,413
who have bound and twisted me.

708
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,849
Get out.

709
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,651
- What?
- Now!

710
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,486
Come, child.

711
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,021
- While the king feels forgiving.
- Henry, no!

712
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:36,689
- Come.
- Get off me!

713
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:39,825
Henry, you poor thing.

714
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,827
- Oh, look at you.
- It all seemed so...

715
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:43,963
so harmless.

716
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:46,699
Oh, Catherine...

717
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,768
Catherine, I am lost.

718
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:51,503
I need God's support.

719
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:54,040
Absolutely.

720
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:58,377
(thunder rumbles)

721
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:08,119
Wait. Where are your things?

722
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,389
I watched you pack. Where is the... ?

723
00:30:10,423 --> 00:30:12,357
I can't go with you.

724
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:13,725
What?

725
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,259
I don't...

726
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:20,732
You mean to send me off without you?

727
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:22,000
What's changed?

728
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:23,868
Why would you do this?

729
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:26,004
My gift, it's truly a curse.

730
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:28,372
I can't escape its
burdens, however far I run.

731
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:30,908
But you can.

732
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:32,577
And you must.

733
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:34,412
No.

734
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,681
- I won't leave you.
- You will.

735
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:38,148
I've seen it, Olivia.

736
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:42,320
I've seen you happy with someone else.

737
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:43,688
You're lying.

738
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:46,023
The vision that changed your mind,

739
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:47,424
we both saw it, didn't we?

740
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,593
That snake was a message from Catherine.

741
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,762
She considers me a weapon

742
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:53,197
she doesn't want to lose.

743
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,865
She will punish me for defying her.

744
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,100
She will kill you.

745
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:59,036
That is the cost of my leaving: your life.

746
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,338
That is her message.

747
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:03,039
But if we were far away...

748
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:05,007
There is no escaping her reach.

749
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:06,743
And what if I stayed?

750
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,878
And be shackled to a man

751
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:10,580
enslaved to a wicked queen?

752
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,415
Oh, that is no life for you.

753
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:14,016
That is barely a life for me.

754
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,519
Be free of this place

755
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:18,455
that has caused you so much pain.

756
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,057
Be free of me.

757
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,525
(thunder rumbling)

758
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:27,029
Pardon. Time to go.

759
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:29,165
Weather's turning.

760
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:30,332
No, no.

761
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,333
My cousins...

762
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:33,035
will look after you.

763
00:31:33,103 --> 00:31:34,070
I've sent them word.

764
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:35,537
Start a new life.

765
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:41,910
And be happy.

766
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,084
(thunder rumbling)

767
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:54,722
(thunder rumbling, bell
ringing in distance)

768
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,178
A letter of credit has
come from your father

769
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:18,813
to the bank where I work.

770
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,615
With your word, I'll sign it,

771
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:22,650
and your dowry will be moved
to your husband's accounts.

772
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,419
Just my word?

773
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,120
It's your father's request.

774
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,521
The money is not yours, of course.

775
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:30,291
Women cannot hold such accounts.

776
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,159
Yes.

777
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:34,054
Heaven knows what foolish things

778
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,589
women might do with our own money.

779
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,491
Gamble, buy prostitutes...

780
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:38,692
I beg your pardon?

781
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:41,228
What if I wait?

782
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:43,864
Does the money stay safe
in my father's accounts?

783
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:46,266
Of course; but safe from what?

784
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,501
Nothing.

785
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:49,603
Hopefully.

786
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,505
I'll send word when I'm ready.

787
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,607
Good day.

788
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:56,777
(knocking on door)

789
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,947
Forgive me, Mary.

790
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,515
Would've requested an audience,

791
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,883
but I seem to have misplaced my footman.

792
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:05,618
Is something wrong?

793
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,753
- The storm is blowing in faster than I thought.
- Yes.

794
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:10,056
- I did notice the sky was darkening.
- Not that storm.

795
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,791
You've heard of the
Lords of the Congregation?

796
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,025
Those tiresome Protestant malcontents?

797
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,994
Tiresome until they agree on something.

798
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,829
They've voted to start a rebellion.

799
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,931
A blockade will provoke a battle

800
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,533
with Catholic authorities,

801
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,302
and then they intend to
remove your mother by force.

802
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,871
You couldn't have missed the weight

803
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,271
of the gold in your valise.

804
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,473
You are guilty

805
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,941
or covering for someone who is.

806
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,642
Is it James?

807
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:35,212
Shall I question your master?

808
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,682
Fetch me his master, the earl.

809
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,518
Take two dozen guards,
and prepare for a fight.

810
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,653
- You may kill if needs be.
- No.

811
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,489
It's, it's not his gold.

812
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,124
Who paid you then?

813
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,625
An Englishman?

814
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,830
Very well.

815
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:56,566
(screaming)

816
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,701
- Where did you hear about this?
- From your own envoy.

817
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,637
- You can ask him yourself.
- Well, what can we do?

818
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,371
Come home to Scotland.

819
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:03,540
Leave now.

820
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:05,007
But Francis, he's not ready yet.

821
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,375
Leave without him.

822
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,643
Let him catch up.

823
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:09,678
He'll only be days behind us.

824
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,414
(grunting)

825
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:16,485
Do you know what this gold
tells me that you won't?

826
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,287
You're brave.

827
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,888
But your loyalty has a price.

828
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:22,591
You sold it once, why not sell it again?

829
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,660
Will you talk if I
promised you your freedom,

830
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:27,796
plus three times the gold you were paid?

831
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:30,766
Five times.

832
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:34,836
And a prince's oath

833
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,805
that I will let you live.

834
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:41,409
Mary, I'm sorry to be so plain.

835
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:42,910
But you never knew our father as I did.

836
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:44,879
You never knew what he dreamed for you.

837
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,814
For your time on his throne.

838
00:34:46,848 --> 00:34:48,983
I can't risk this marriage, this alliance,

839
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,985
for a dead man's dreams, even my father's.

840
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,587
Can you risk it for Scotland?

841
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:54,922
Would you rather be the
queen you were born to be

842
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,891
or a pawn of the French court?

843
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,764
Finish packing my things.

844
00:35:03,832 --> 00:35:05,232
Only enough for two weeks.

845
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,781
Francis can bring the rest, if he follows.

846
00:35:06,848 --> 00:35:08,215
I'm leaving for Scotland.

847
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:09,717
Today.

848
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:11,151
<i>FRANCIS: Ten times the gold you were paid.</i>

849
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,520
And you can buy all
the courtesans you want.

850
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:17,057
And you swear I'll be spared?

851
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,159
I'll be set free?

852
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:20,694
If I believe your story, you'll be placed

853
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:23,330
on the ship of your choosing, by my men.

854
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:26,667
And what happens to you
after that is up to you.

855
00:35:29,036 --> 00:35:32,972
I was paid to murder the Queen
of Scots on her voyage home.

856
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,974
- Who paid you?
- Englishmen.

857
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:38,912
I didn't know them, but
I heard them talking.

858
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:41,915
They want James to be Scotland's king.

859
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,784
Married less than a week,

860
00:35:57,818 --> 00:35:58,952
and you've already tired of me?

861
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,288
I don't feel well is all.

862
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:02,322
I... is it the baby?

863
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:03,991
No, I...

864
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:05,792
I think it's just nerves.

865
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:09,263
There's... (sighs) so much uncertainty.

866
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:12,766
The baby, my future...

867
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,001
my husband...

868
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:17,504
You're uncertain about me?

869
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:19,873
I fear we don't know each other well.

870
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,209
Is there anything weighing on you?

871
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:28,147
Any troubles of yours a wife might share?

872
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,986
I... I'm sure, in time,

873
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:36,155
we'll share everything.

874
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:38,991
You may even tell me
who fathered your baby.

875
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:41,727
Our baby.

876
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,229
Or I may never ask.

877
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:46,498
Because it may not matter.

878
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:49,535
What matters is how we
feel about one another.

879
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:51,637
And I feel love for you.

880
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:55,240
I know it all happened very quickly, but

881
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:56,975
that's where we are.

882
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:58,176
Together.

883
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,028
With our secrets. With our pasts.

884
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:03,116
I swear, if I believed
knowing every single thing

885
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,685
about one another could
protect us from future troubles,

886
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,489
I would tell you every moment of my past.

887
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:11,491
But...

888
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:12,959
my life...

889
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:16,763
this... wonderful life,

890
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:21,033
began the day you agreed to be my bride.

891
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,770
Then why do I feel afraid?

892
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:26,873
Because life is full of uncertainty.

893
00:37:26,907 --> 00:37:29,542
(quiet laugh) That's why we love.

894
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:31,911
To face it with someone.

895
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:34,446
Together.

896
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,982
Let's face life together, Lola.

897
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,484
You and me.

898
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:40,953
Can we?

899
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,391
My father believed that actor

900
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,192
was part of the Vatican delegation.

901
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,328
You did it.

902
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:50,662
And now you're saying we're rich?

903
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:52,898
Well, richer than we were.

904
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:55,033
That estate that Henry promised Penelope

905
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,735
belonged to Catherine;
she's given it to us.

906
00:37:56,803 --> 00:37:59,037
She also let me keep her ring.

907
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:01,005
Well, you have everything you wanted:

908
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:03,341
land, money, jewelry...

909
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:04,910
Practically everything.

910
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:11,983
I was able to get this back as well.

911
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:14,885
Penelope looked so pathetic,
back in the kitchen.

912
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,421
Yet still, I couldn't resist.

913
00:38:16,488 --> 00:38:18,589
Should I buy you a new ring,

914
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:19,757
now that we can afford it?

915
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,525
No, you fool, you gave it to me.

916
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:25,830
Such a queer feeling,
whenever I look at it.

917
00:38:25,897 --> 00:38:27,598
What's that?

918
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,667
A sort of certainty.

919
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:32,402
One I've never felt before.

920
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:33,704
Someone's always going to be looking

921
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,573
out for me now, no matter what.

922
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,008
I'm not sure you need looking out for.

923
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:40,344
Well...

924
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:42,346
I'm stuck with him, aren't I?

925
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,015
Might as well put him to some kind of use.

926
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:57,226
Leave...

927
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,395
me alone.

928
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:00,930
Get...

929
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:03,265
out.

930
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,901
Please!

931
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,736
Go.

932
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:13,710
Will my sins never leave me?

933
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:15,079
Did the footman tell you

934
00:39:15,113 --> 00:39:16,314
that James was involved with the plot?

935
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:17,648
No, but can you take that chance?

936
00:39:17,682 --> 00:39:19,650
I take that chance every day.

937
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:21,852
The English are constantly
plotting against me.

938
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:23,220
If they want a Protestant king in Scotland,

939
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:24,355
of course they would choose James.

940
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:25,556
But do you really think

941
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,325
that he had no inkling of this?

942
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,159
His own man in the pay of your enemies?

943
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:32,195
James has written to me of
dozens of plots against me.

944
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:34,565
Plots that were to his benefit.

945
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,700
He tells me because he wants
what is best for Scotland.

946
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,268
As he knows I do.

947
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:40,270
Mary, please, we will go later,

948
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:41,371
when it is safe.

949
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:43,106
My mother is in jeopardy now.

950
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,675
Scotland is in jeopardy now.

951
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,077
I said we'll go when it's safe.

952
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:48,611
We will never be safe.

953
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:50,447
I know that you're afraid

954
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:52,715
this is a trap. I am, too.

955
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,684
But I need to take this chance.

956
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:57,587
I have to.

957
00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:59,755
I will be home soon.

958
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,125
Please trust me.

959
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,728
(quietly): I can't.

960
00:40:05,762 --> 00:40:07,396
Guards! Surround the queen.

961
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,900
What are you doing?

962
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:14,770
(thunder rumbling)

963
00:40:14,805 --> 00:40:16,572
Locked in the tower?

964
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:19,208
Did you think that I would
try to slink out of my rooms,

965
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,775
like a rat in a passageway?

966
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,776
Not like a rat.

967
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:24,013
Like a defiant queen.

968
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,115
You will be released as soon
as your brother has cast off.

969
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:27,949
I told him that we'd
follow as soon as we could.

970
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:30,619
- So, you lied?
- It is not a lie.

971
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:33,088
- When I know that it is safe to...
- It will be too late!

972
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:36,124
We both know that day will never come.

973
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:37,759
I will not help you with the cardinal,

974
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:39,260
if that's what you think.

975
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,129
I know.

976
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,664
My mother and I will

977
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:44,900
do what we have to; we'll find a way.

978
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,434
You may hate me right now,

979
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:49,237
but I have done this for you.

980
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:51,639
I love you, and I've put you first.

981
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:54,075
<i>You love a girl!</i>

982
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:57,111
You don't love a queen or
you would allow me to be one!

983
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:59,180
You are putting yourself
and your country first,

984
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:01,516
- just as you always have!
- That is not true.

985
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,152
If Scotland falls, I
will never forgive you!

986
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,854
You will lose my country,
and you will lose me!

987
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,823
I warned you, Francis...
we are one and the same.

988
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:11,291
Scotland won't fall.

989
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,093
And neither will we.

990
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:15,462
I can't hear another word. Get out!

991
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:20,768
I'll be back when you've
had a chance to calm down.

992
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:23,270
Francis...

993
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:25,539
You can't just leave me
locked in here... Francis!

994
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,809
