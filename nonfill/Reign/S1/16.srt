<i>Previously on</i> Reign:

9
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,348
- Is that my husband's child?
- Yes.

10
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:36,147
I just lied to Francis for you!

11
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:38,735
You made a mistake
and now you have to fix it

12
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,587
before it destroys my marriage.

13
00:00:40,588 --> 00:00:43,590
My family is depending on me
to bring home a title and lands.

14
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,824
You're a servant.

15
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:46,723
Lord Castleroy has
offered me an apprenticeship

16
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:48,227
at one of his spice houses in Spain.

17
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:51,330
BASH: The night Francis' men were escorting
me out of the country, they tried to kill me.

18
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,065
On his orders, I believe.

19
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:54,500
Francis wouldn't. You know that.

20
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,769
It's the Darkness.
I won't rest until it's dead.

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,970
You can't fight it.

22
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,405
NOSTRADAMUS:
What happened to the poor girl?

23
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:01,073
There's a dark malignant
power in the woods.

24
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:04,949
- That creature that requires blood.
- The Darkness. It will take us all.

25
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:11,182

28
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:20,358

(shudders)

33
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,336
The nightmares again?

34
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:33,304
(door closes)

35
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:37,374
(panting): What I endured while
I was captive in that cave

36
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,475
will always be a part of me.

37
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:41,045
(breathing heavily):
The Darkness...

38
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:42,680
Can't reach you anymore.

39
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:45,315
(continues breathing heavily)

40
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,520
When the body
endures a trauma,

41
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,789
it's hard for the mind to let go.

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,191
Don't let your mind sabotage you.

43
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:56,960
You're ready to rejoin society.

44
00:01:58,163 --> 00:01:59,363
(gasps)

45
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:00,997
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:02,399
- I only meant...
- No. It's not you.

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,635
It hurts.

48
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:06,470
My back.

49
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,571
May I?

50
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,244
(panting)

51
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:18,181
What is it?

52
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:22,986
I thought all your wounds were healing,
but this one's become infected.

53
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:24,453
I need to drain it.

54
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:31,527
(skin ripping)

55
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,529
(moans, breathing heavily)

56
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,300
There, the wound should begin to...

57
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,501
Wait...

58
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:42,237
There's something inside.

59
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:43,405
(metal clinks)

60
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:45,875
Brace yourself, Olivia.

61
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:48,677
(panting)

62
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,546
(short heavy breathing)

63
00:02:56,886 --> 00:03:00,722
<i>MARQUIS: But when the Baron insults me,
he also insults you, King Henry.</i>

64
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:03,103
<i>I must ask that you
send your forces to Guyenne</i>

65
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:05,666
to demonstrate your power
and <i>my</i> authority.

66
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:09,130
Your Majesty?

67
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,534
(inhales deeply) Marquis Duveaux.

68
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,802
When you last presented
me with your grievance,

69
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,003
what did I say?

70
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:17,605
But, Your Majesty,
the Baron disrespects...

71
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:20,908
Clearly you did not listen, because
I ordered you to return home

72
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,245
and to bend the Baron to your authority,
by your own power.

73
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,983
This has been the source of my fury.
People who refuse to listen to their king.

74
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:33,420
Or... are your ears
full of wax, hmm?

75
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,323
Hold him down.

76
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:37,658
- What are you doing?
- Just so.

77
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,461
(Marquis grunts)

78
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:43,497
Please, Your Majesty.
(panting) I beg you.

79
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,166
(Marquis screaming)

80
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,969
Henry?! Henry!
What are you doing?!

81
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,004
Teaching the Marquis a lesson.

82
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,007
CATHERINE: - Not like this, he's a nobleman.
HENRY: - Release him.

83
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,724
I understand you canceled the
Queen of the Bean Celebration.

84
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,745
- Now we're talking about a party.
- I know what you're trying to do.

85
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,580
You're trying to hide
me from my own court.

86
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,749
Perhaps you're trying to
poison me as well, hmm?

87
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,185
(sighs)
I'm not trying to poison you, Henry.

88
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:07,787
I'm concerned.

89
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:11,123
What's wrong with you
isn't any poison I've delivered,

90
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:12,191
I swear to you.

91
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:14,093
But you <i>are</i> ill.

92
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:15,762
You could do harm
to yourself, to France.

93
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:18,298
I have headaches.
They come and go, but...

94
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,667
my mind is sharper than
it's ever been before.

95
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,469
And the Queen of the Bean is
nearly my favorite event of the year.

96
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,538
It will proceed, as usual.

97
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:30,276
(indistinct conversation, laughter)

98
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,803
So any servant can become
queen for the day?

99
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:36,849
- I don't remember this tradition.
- It's 'cause we were children.

100
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,717
I think my mother hid
it from us for a while.

101
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,151
Ah.

102
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:43,689
My father welcomes
the temporary queen in his own way.

103
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,123
In his bed.

104
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:49,027
(chuckles) If the girl who finds the bean
in her slice of cake happens to be pretty.

105
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:50,025
(laughs)

106
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:52,163
She wears my mother's crown,
the finest clothes,

107
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:53,965
and spends the day
ordering servants around.

108
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:56,300
By dawn, she has a hundred
ducats, a pile of gifts,

109
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,236
but she is a servant girl once more.

110
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,338
A true fairy tale ending.

111
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,307
It's a tradition I always
prefer to avoid.

112
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,809
Especially when
Diane de Poitiers was here.

113
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,478
To watch my father juggling
a mistress, my mother...

114
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:08,679
and the Bean Queen.

115
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,815
(laughing)

116
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:11,801
Bash and I always fled for a hunt.

117
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:16,025
It's all right to miss him.

118
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,655
Even though he angered you.

119
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:19,357
(children laughing)

120
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:22,760
Well, at least the bean gives them
something new to gossip about.

121
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,695
It's the first time in weeks

122
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:26,530
that no one's pestered me
about giving you heirs.

123
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,265
Perhaps I should pester you.

124
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,436
KENNA: Mary,

125
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:34,938
Greer's ready to
present him to you now.

126
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,273
Who?

127
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,541
Lord Julien. Greer's fiancé.

128
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,044
(indistinct conversation)

129
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,606
Such a gorgeous cake
and they're not even eating it.

130
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,355
We should send the losers
a consolation gift.

131
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:53,356
Don't you think?

132
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:55,666
He arrived two days ago.

133
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,008
Isn't he adorable?

134
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,862
LOLA: They've had some talks

135
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,963
- and Greer says he's quite nice.
- And quite rich.

136
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:03,266
Why can't the king
find me a husband like that?

137
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:06,135
We've been here a year,
all but rotting on the vine.

138
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:11,440
Lord Julien, may I introduce you to
Her Majesty, Mary, Queen of Scots.

139
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,609
And her ladies, Lola and Kenna.

140
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,981
Your Majesty, it is an honor.

141
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:18,480
Lord Julien, it's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

142
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,915
I hear that your family's
from Hungary.

143
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,885
Yes. My parents know Greer's father
through a distant cousin.

144
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:25,320
We corresponded and the rest is history.

145
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:29,124
I hope you'll find it in your heart
to bless our engagement.

146
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,960
If this is what your father
wishes... and you of course.

147
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,829
It is. Very much.

148
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,351
Well then, (claps) you're engaged.

149
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:38,700
- (Julien laughs)
- Enjoy your lives together.

150
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,235
(laughter)

151
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:41,702
I'm so happy for you, Greer.

152
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,273
He's certainly a
step up from Castleroy.

153
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,574
Yeah.

154
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,977
Lord Castleroy,
can I get you anything?

155
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:50,845
No. No need. You're busy.

156
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:55,249
(laughs) Just think, tomorrow you'll
be my apprentice in the spice trade.

157
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,918
You'll leave all this behind.

158
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,487
Will you miss it?

159
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,089
(clears throat)

160
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,558
I'm very grateful, sir.

161
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:10,697
Lola, I have some bad news.

162
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,167
The suitor from Alsace has
been delayed for five weeks.

163
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:15,970
I'm going to start
to show any day now.

164
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,272
Lola, I promised you I'd
find you a husband and I will.

165
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:21,041
Just give me another week, maybe two.

166
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,648
I see your plan to keep the
king out of sight has failed.

167
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,216
Who else knows of his madness?

168
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,785
Only Kenna.

169
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,720
<i>And</i> a nobleman from Guyenne.

170
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,055
I've given both motivation
to keep quiet.

171
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,158
But there's no telling
what Henry will do next. (sighs)

172
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,795
Have you found
any explanation for this?

173
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,630
I've checked his food and wine
for three days straight.

174
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,167
There's no trace of any poison.
At least none that I recognize.

175
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,536
Then he is mad.

176
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:54,673
And a mad king incites
chaos and rebellion.

177
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,975
If our enemies find out, we could...

178
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,342
Your Majesty...

179
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,881
- What's this?
- A sedative that induces a coma.

180
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:05,484
A deep sleep that I can interrupt
with an antidote of my own design.

181
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,819
It'll be difficult.

182
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,589
He has seven tasters,
inspecting every manner of delivery.

183
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,725
We have to find a way
to get it past them.

184
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,060
A Trojan horse.

185
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,967
(woman screams)

186
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,829
WOMAN: Yes! Yes! I've won!

187
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,064
The bean!

188
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,399
I found the bean!

189
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,500
(sniffles)

190
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:23,835
(applause)

191
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,740
What is your name?

192
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,242
Uh... Penelope.

193
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:32,464
From the kitchen.

194
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,413
Well, you're very pretty. (panting)

195
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,181
Penelope...

196
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,350
I crown you...

197
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:43,617
Queen of the Bean.

198
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,289
(applause)

199
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,997
(applause, cheering)

200
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:09,780
Ask and ye shall receive.

201
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:19,755
- I need to speak with the king.
- It's the bastard!

202
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:22,559
I surrender to the king's mercy.

203
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,659
Bash.

204
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,960
Father, I need to speak with you.

205
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,363
You return from exile seeking favor?

206
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:28,931
After you killed
your brother's guards?

207
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:30,833
It was self-defense.
Take him to the dungeon.

208
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,602
There's a threat in the woods,
that's why I've returned.

209
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,003
Father. Father,
you must listen to me.

210
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:35,271
I mean you no harm,

211
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:36,505
but there are people
who are being harmed.

212
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:37,673
Murdered!

213
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:39,008
I can't believe he came back.

214
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,843
What was he thinking?

215
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:42,578
- Father, you must!
- We have given him every chance

216
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,413
to be free and yet here he is.

217
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:47,316
I'm done helping him.

218
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,953
- Francis, he's your brother.
- He's a liar and a murderer.

219
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:54,923
We both know why he came back.

220
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,126
Don't give him another chance
to get close to you.

221
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:04,214
(chain rattles)

222
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:07,618
We don't have much time,
so listen carefully.

223
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,287
I've bribed your jailer.

224
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:12,957
A merchant's wagon will take
you to the Spanish border.

225
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,226
If you value your life, you will do
as I say and you will never return.

226
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,863
- I'm not ready to go to Spain.
- Bash, what is wrong with you?

227
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:21,619
You never should have returned here.
You have to leave.

228
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,166
There are too many in
the castle who want you dead.

229
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,535
You mean Francis?

230
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,804
He did not try to have you killed.

231
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:30,374
Although he could.

232
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:34,744
You stir up a jealousy and a bitterness
in him that scares me.

233
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,079
He gets this look in his eyes.

234
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,363
It's like I don't know him.

235
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:41,595
It's almost as if he knows.

236
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:42,946
That you'd have been
happy without him.

237
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:44,571
If you had married me instead.

238
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:49,301
There is nothing between you and
I except for my concern for you.

239
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:51,728
Then we've arrived at the same spot.

240
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:55,398
I'm here on behalf of another,
a girl I met in the woods.

241
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,477
Well, bully for you and your
speedy recovery.

242
00:10:57,478 --> 00:11:00,002
Don't. Not until you hear
what happened to her.

243
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,440
CATHERINE: <i>Queen Penelope.</i>

244
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:07,076
Every year a girl is chosen.

245
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,711
Yes.

246
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:14,416
And for a brief moment,
she glimpses the heavens of royalty.

247
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,185
Ah, it's the greatest night of her life.

248
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:21,790
But when the dawn comes,
she must fall back to earth.

249
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,059
Oh, it must be a brutal fall.

250
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,461
Oh. It's all right.

251
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:29,964
I mean, this is so much
more than I ever...

252
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,167
I ever even dreamed of.

253
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:33,634
But it's only one day.

254
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:37,105
And I...

255
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:40,575
would like you to be the first
Queen of the Bean in history

256
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,743
to think long-term.

257
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,079
So if you prove
yourself trustworthy,

258
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,115
we can be friends. And unlike Henry,

259
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:50,117
I look after my friends
every day of the year,

260
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:52,578
not just this one.

261
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,557
Tell me, Queen Penelope,
have you maintained your virtue?

262
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,926
Of course I have. (chuckles)

263
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,462
Because... well, as you may know...

264
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:04,565
when pretty girls
win Queen of the Bean,

265
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:07,366
they sometimes have a...

266
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:10,471
special experience with the king.

267
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:12,306
- Oh?
- I must warn you that the king's...

268
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:17,310
appetite in his bedchambers
can be quite... rough.

269
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:20,880
He has the appetite of a lion
and the stamina of a horse,

270
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,816
a horse that proceeds at a steady,

271
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,851
punishing trot.

272
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:29,122
It can be a... lengthy experience.

273
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,491
Well... how lengthy?

274
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:34,163
It can feel like hours.
Sometimes it is.

275
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,929
But... if we're to be friends,

276
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,532
I can help you. (chuckles)

277
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:44,937
This is an aphrodisiac.

278
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:49,017
It'll help the king... gallop
more quickly to the finish.

279
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,976
Pour the contents
of this into his wine.

280
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:52,832
Get him to drink it.

281
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:57,783
It will thrill him and satisfy him,
and you will be on to more gowns

282
00:12:57,784 --> 00:13:00,664
and jewels and the feast.

283
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,323
I came down here
because I was worried about you,

284
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,530
and here I find you
with my wife. Again.

285
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:15,433
- Should I feign surprise?
- It's not what it looks like.

286
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,001
- He didn't come for me.
- Oh, even you can't believe that.

287
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:20,872
I'm back for the castle's resources,
its armed men and horses,

288
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:23,941
to seek out and destroy
a threat in the woods.

289
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:26,444
And then I will leave. I promise.

290
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:27,530
What threat?

291
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:30,271
You've seen the sacrifices
in the Blood Wood.

292
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:33,898
These pagans endanger every man,
woman and child in the realm.

293
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,897
They threatened your own wife.

294
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,956
And they do it all in service to
a monster they call the Darkness.

295
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:41,896
- I know how it sounds...
- You sound as ignorant as those pagans.

296
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:45,863
- A monster in the woods?
- I saw it, in the shadows, myself.

297
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:48,632
It took a girl, a girl I cared for.

298
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:51,835
Her name was Rowan,
and now she is certainly dead.

299
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,371
However badly you want me
gone, I promise, I want it

300
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,339
a thousand times more,
but I'm not leaving

301
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,573
until the woods are safe.

302
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,175
Mary, leave us please.

303
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,643
I know you don't believe me.

304
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:02,845
But there's someone
you will believe.

305
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:04,847
And who is that?

306
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:06,916
The Darkness has claimed
countless victims.

307
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,251
Only one survived.

308
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:10,553
Your old flame, Olivia D'Amencourt.

309
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:13,923
And she's here in
this castle right now.

310
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:20,530
(knocking)

311
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:25,034
Leith, what are you doing here?
We've said our good-byes.

312
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:30,105
I had to see you,
just once more.

313
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,074
Look, I wanted to tell you...

314
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:35,044
No, don't. Why?

315
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:37,712
Because you're engaged to
another man who you barely know?

316
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:40,682
That's not at all unusual
for someone like me.

317
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:42,384
Because you're highborn.

318
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:47,055
And he's rich and titled
and very kind to the servants.

319
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,356
And to me.

320
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:52,460
He seems...
everything I ever wanted.

321
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,366
Except he's not you.

322
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,181
(panting)

323
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,785
(gasps) WOMAN: Excuse me, my lady.

324
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,053
Greer? Lord Julien,

325
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:20,054
I...

326
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,254
Who are you? I'm no one.

327
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,489
I'm a servant. I-I fancied her

328
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,989
and-and she was kind
so I stole the kiss.

329
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,961
- Leith, no.
- No, this is not her fault.

330
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:28,862
She asked me not to,
but I was overcome.

331
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:30,130
She is free of blame in this.

332
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:32,532
My-my advance was unwanted!

333
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,167
I don't want him harmed,

334
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,470
but his household
will have to know of this.

335
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,040
(sighs)

336
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:45,612
I was going to leave
this in your room...

337
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,614
It wasn't his fault. (chuckles)

338
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,249
Is that supposed to make it better?

339
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,984
I'm so sorry.

340
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:53,987
I know these things happen.

341
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:56,455
But they can't with my wife.

342
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,525
I-I can't have this kind of
gossip surrounding my family.

343
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,193
I can't have this.

344
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,529
I'll be ruined if
you don't marry me.

345
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,799
I wish I could.

346
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,201
I-I wish I were a better man

347
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,303
who could marry you despite this.

348
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,305
But I'm not.

349
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,807
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,282
(crying)

351
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:36,095
- Olivia, we're so sorry.
- Everything that you endured,

352
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:39,165
we thought... I thought that you escaped
through the tunnels that night.

353
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,333
I did.

354
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,870
But I was found by those heretics,
fed to that monster.

355
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,906
Do you believe me now?

356
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:50,442
This creature is the cause of
all the horrors in those woods.

357
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,678
If you want to protect
your realm from these devils,

358
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,513
you must kill the
monster they serve.

359
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,615
I don't believe in monsters.
I never have.

360
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,217
But I do believe in fear.

361
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,852
And whoever this Darkness is,

362
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,454
the pagans fear him enough to terrorize
and slaughter my people.

363
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:07,393
Olivia, do you think that you could retrace
your steps, lead us back to the cave?

364
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,262
No.

365
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,231
All I remember is a meadow
lined with fir trees,

366
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,934
hugged by a curving field of snow.

367
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,303
BASH: I know a meadow with some firs
near where we found her.

368
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,059
- I'll gather my guards.
- You'll forgive me,

369
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,307
but the last time I went
with your men, they tried to kill me.

370
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,910
I gave no such order,
and we could confirm that

371
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,744
- if you hadn't slaughtered them.
- Francis.

372
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,381
This time I'm going with you.

373
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,716
We'll find that cave and
kill whatever hides within.

374
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,719
And then I am personally putting
you on the next boat to Spain.

375
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,923
Then we're agreed.

376
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,725
You can't just kill it!

377
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,694
This isn't some outlaw
hiding in the trees!

378
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,630
The Darkness is a
creature from hell.

379
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,650
It's not human. (door opens)

380
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:51,469
NOSTRADAMUS: He is human, I assure you.

381
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,238
I found this embedded
in Olivia's wound.

382
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,673
It looked like the fang
of some wild beast,

383
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,243
but the root of this tooth
is like yours or mine.

384
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:04,915
This fang is a human tooth,
filed down into a sharp point.

385
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,783
Human? But why would a
man go to such lengths?

386
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:11,455
For function, perhaps.
To better feed on victims.

387
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:16,593
But I assure you,
this Darkness is only a man.

388
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:19,830
Then go and kill him.

389
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,599
And remember
who the real enemy is.

390
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:33,642
(sniffles) Do you know what happens
to servants like Leith?

391
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:36,679
They say he'll get
the lash until his back is

392
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,615
split open and he can
no longer stand.

393
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,784
He'll spend years in that cell.

394
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:43,772
(sniffles) I love him.

395
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:46,106
You can't love a servant,
you simply can't.

396
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:50,025
- Not that what I did was much better.
- But it is. (sniffles)

397
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,861
Mistresses of the king
are often revered,

398
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,896
but-but this...

399
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:57,299
My family will fall
into ruin for what I've done.

400
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,368
I'll never be able
to face them again.

401
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,504
- It's not that dire yet.
- The gossip is already spreading.

402
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:06,208
These rumors will follow
me everywhere.

403
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,643
I have no future.

404
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:10,412
MARY: Greer, don't say that.

405
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,314
Never say that.

406
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:18,520
Mary... (sniffles) so you've heard.

407
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,822
I'm so ashamed.

408
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,724
Please don't be.

409
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,893
Look at us.

410
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:27,529
Look where our hearts have led us.

411
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,864
We've brought you shame.

412
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:31,633
Well, all but Lola.

413
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,103
In truth, there's something
you should know.

414
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,939
(sighs)

415
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,076
HENRY: <i>Why is the queen
of Scotland so concerned</i>

416
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,744
with the fate of a kitchen boy?

417
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:46,080
Leith saved many lives at the siege.

418
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,016
In light of his bravery, I feel that
his sentence should be reduced.

419
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:51,018
This kitchen boy seems to have
friends in high places.

420
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:53,119
You're not the first
to plead on his behalf.

421
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,088
Lord Castleroy has arranged that.

422
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,857
In lieu of prison,
he's been conscripted

423
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,258
for military service.

424
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,094
He departs for training tomorrow.

425
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:03,296
Ah, my queen.

426
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:05,598
What a vision.

427
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,100
Isn't she lovely, Mary?

428
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:09,369
Yes, it takes a very
special kind of woman

429
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,603
to catch my eye

430
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:11,871
and ignite my passion.

431
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:13,239
Hmm? (belt clatters)

432
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,241
- I should go.
- No, no, no, no.

433
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:19,645
Stay. Now that you've given
your virtue to my son,

434
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:23,482
perhaps you can show Penelope
a thing or two about how to...

435
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,718
please a ruler.

436
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,987
Go on. Pretend she's...

437
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,389
Francis. I'll watch.

438
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,125
(chuckles) Oh, you aren't serious?

439
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,460
Mm-hmm.

440
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:37,162
This isn't like you.

441
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:39,498
Are you feeling unwell, Your Grace?

442
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,800
I am anointed by God.

443
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,969
You are as well. We are royals.

444
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,474
What could ever be...
unwell with us, hmm?

445
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:51,676
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

446
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:55,947
May I borrow Penelope for a minute?

447
00:20:55,948 --> 00:21:00,251
I have some royal customs
and-and clothes to share with her.

448
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,920
Penelope, if you would?

449
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,855
(clears throat)

450
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:07,425
I suppose... the queen shall stay.

451
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm fine, run along.

452
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,533
Dear Henry,

453
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:18,536
when we last... talked,

454
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:20,471
you spoke to me about bondage.

455
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:22,640
You seem familiar with the practice.

456
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,074
Servants talk.

457
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,610
I hear you like it.

458
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:26,810
(soft laugh)

459
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:28,278
It's to be expected.

460
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,481
A king must have
power and control.

461
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:32,549
It's part of his job.

462
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:38,455
But... even the biggest
of jobs can become so dull.

463
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:41,458
Here.

464
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,461
(quietly laughs)

465
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:46,296
It's just you and me.

466
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,565
I'll take control.

467
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:50,767
I can give you the pleasure
you offer others.

468
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,972
I have always been
on the giving end.

469
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:57,807
How tiring for you.

470
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:03,345
Poor King Henry.

471
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:13,389
Get on the bed. Hmm?

472
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,158
Get on the bed. Now.

473
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,726
Oh, I like this.

474
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:18,060
Shh.

475
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:20,229
Bad king.

476
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,097
You won't speak again
unless spoken to.

477
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:23,865
Do you understand?

478
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,541
(grunts)

479
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:33,875
Split up and search the area.

480
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:35,177
Yes, my lord.

481
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:37,012
The cave must be close by.

482
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:38,780
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, sir.

483
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,750
This way.

484
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:45,620
Bash, you come with me.

485
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:47,723
We'll go on foot from here.

486
00:22:49,592 --> 00:22:51,892
You didn't give me a weapon.

487
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:53,595
Are you planning to have
them kill me, brother?

488
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:57,565
You there, go with the others.

489
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:02,637
You have made so many enemies,
why fixate on me?

490
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:04,639
You reached for the
throne and failed,

491
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,874
nobles everywhere despise you.

492
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,043
Maybe it's easier
to make me the villain,

493
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:12,579
so you have a reason to hate me
and an excuse to go after my wife.

494
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,080
Listen to you.

495
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:16,617
You have Mary and the crown

496
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:18,719
and all of France puckering
its lips to your ass,

497
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,455
and still you're threatened
by a bastard in exile.

498
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:22,989
I used to look up to you.

499
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,659
You were the one person
that I could rely on.

500
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,262
But I was wrong.
You are a traitor and a usurper.

501
00:23:29,263 --> 00:23:31,898
Well, go ahead, do it then.

502
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:33,599
Kill me.

503
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,735
Bash.

504
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:41,307
BASH: Fresh tracks.

505
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:43,676
We're not alone.

506
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,394
I don't see Henry. Did you
manage to fulfill my request?

507
00:23:57,997 --> 00:23:59,531
The aphrodisiac.

508
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:02,434
(chuckles) You needn't worry about that.

509
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:05,703
He, uh, doesn't need an aphrodisiac.

510
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:09,540
The king... goes a little bit
mad sometimes, doesn't he?

511
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:14,412
And, uh... this is his medicine?

512
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:18,350
You are a clever girl, aren't you?

513
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:21,285
- (soft laugh)
- I'll see that it's done.

514
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:23,087
I know how to handle him.

515
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,122
Hmm. Do you? (short chuckle)

516
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:25,923
(laughter)

517
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:26,924
Oh.

518
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,627
Guests.

519
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:30,728
Um...

520
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,262
Uh, would you mind?

521
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,263
Come again?

522
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,032
My throne?

523
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:39,470
Of course.

524
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:41,838
Enjoy it, my dear. (short chuckle)

525
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:49,013
You stupid kitchen whore.

526
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,151
Lola, the party's starting.

527
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:56,753
Why aren't you ready? What's wrong?

528
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:58,655
I can't fit in my dress.

529
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:00,624
Mary, we're out of time.

530
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,826
Lola, we said we would
help each other,

531
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:03,994
and we already have.

532
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:05,802
What do you mean?

533
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:08,865
Marry Lord Julien.

534
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,699
- What?
- He came to France

535
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,135
looking to make a good marriage.

536
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,806
You offer him everything
he's looking for.

537
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:15,871
What about Greer?

538
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:19,008
It was Greer's idea. She wants
to help you move forward.

539
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:22,445
Julien spurned her,
although she says he did it kindly.

540
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:23,546
It isn't fair.

541
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:28,383
Greer is punished and scorned
while I'm rewarded.

542
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:33,354
Lola. I don't mean to sound blunt
or selfish, but I need this to work.

543
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:37,693
My marriage is threatened
from all sides.

544
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:42,731
Bash's return has Francis poisoned
by jealousy and mistrust.

545
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,874
We can never be happy
while he's here.

546
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,096
And you, you're pregnant
with my husband's child,

547
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:49,204
- and if Francis finds out...
- I understand.

548
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:53,608
And I never want to be a threat
to your happiness.

549
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:59,480
If you can help sway
Lord Julien in my direction,

550
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:03,585
I will do my very best to marry him.
And quickly.

551
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:13,561
(horse neighs)

552
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:16,263
What's spooked him?

553
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,173
(wild, whistling shriek)

554
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:27,708
What was that?

555
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,009
BASH: I've heard that
whistle before.

556
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,377
It's the Darkness.

557
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:31,712
Guards.

558
00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:33,847
My lord?

559
00:26:33,848 --> 00:26:35,048
Do you see anyone?

560
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:36,282
No one for miles, my lord.

561
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:37,550
Where are the rest of the guards?

562
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,819
Searching for the cave.

563
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:44,758
The footprints just stop.

564
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,861
What do you mean?
How is that possible?

565
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:50,363
Wait, there's something here.

566
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:54,367
What is it?

567
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:57,770
(cracking)

568
00:26:57,771 --> 00:26:59,372
No,

569
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:00,607
don't come any closer.

570
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:02,609
(loud cracking)

571
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,678
Francis!

572
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,014
Francis!

573
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:12,051
Francis!

574
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:14,186
(panting)

575
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:17,957
My lord,

576
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,291
my lord!

577
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:21,127
Stay back. The ice is too thin.

578
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:24,663
(grunting)

579
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:26,331
Where are you? Where are you?

580
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,768
There's a current.

581
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:40,411
Francis.

582
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:42,714
Francis!

583
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,517
No. No, Francis.

584
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:52,924
(grunting)

585
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:58,529
(grunts) Francis.

586
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,031
Aah!

587
00:28:01,032 --> 00:28:02,433
(growling)

588
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:15,378
Breathe, breathe. Live, live.

589
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,984
(panting)

590
00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:27,224
Francis. Please.

591
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:29,459
Please.

592
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:39,235
You are beautiful and cruel.

593
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,038
(laughs)

594
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:47,139
Lady Greer, well done
with that kitchen boy.

595
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,660
That nasty gossip is the first interesting
thing I've ever heard about you.

596
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:51,849
What a horrible thing to say.

597
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,983
Oh, you should be grateful.

598
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:55,853
Now people might finally stop
wagging their tongues about you.

599
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,691
MARY: Are you all right?
What happened?

600
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:06,363
Henry can be such a monster.
Heartless and cruel.

601
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:08,665
At least he had the courage
to be cruel to my face.

602
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:13,137
The rest of court sniggers behind
my back, as if I can't hear.

603
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:17,006
I'm so sorry. But thank you

604
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:20,176
for what you've done for Lola.
I know it can't be easy.

605
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:23,112
I had my chance,
and I threw it away.

606
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,251
I wouldn't be so sure.

607
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,655
Lord Castleroy.

608
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:34,523
I heard what you did for Leith.

609
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,559
Getting him out of jail,
into the army.

610
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,328
I want to offer my
sincerest gratitude.

611
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:41,097
I didn't do it for him.
I did it for you.

612
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:45,435
Gossip surrounds me
and still you seek my favor. Why?

613
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:46,735
You have a good heart.

614
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:49,234
And I'm too rich to care
what people say.

615
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:51,695
What I care about is you.

616
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:52,575
I know...

617
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:57,112
I'm not the man of your dreams, but a
marriage would put all rumors to rest.

618
00:29:57,113 --> 00:29:58,747
It's not that simple.

619
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:00,315
But it is.

620
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:02,150
The world is cruel,

621
00:30:02,151 --> 00:30:04,086
and it will be cruel
to the next sweet girl

622
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:09,424
who has the misfortune of opening her
heart to someone others don't even see.

623
00:30:12,428 --> 00:30:14,396
I see you now.

624
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,298
And you are so kind.

625
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:19,034
Then will you accept
my humble proposal?

626
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:23,170
Yes.

627
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,906
Yes, I accept.

628
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:27,208
Oh.

629
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:32,113
Thank you.

630
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:34,482

00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:55,769
I'm feeling better.

638

Perhaps it is time

639
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,273
as you said.

Come.

00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:06,246
I'm sorry.

643

Is the chill still with you?

646
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:22,562
I feel lucky to be alive.

647
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:26,432
(sighs)

648
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:31,270
I would have died under that ice.
You saved my life.

649
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:34,874
Was that wise since you
believe I tried to kill you?

650
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,676
I did believe that, didn't I?

651
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:39,946
Then why risk your life for mine?

652
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:42,548
You're my brother.

653
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,952
Have you sent word to
Mary that we're back?

654
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:48,454
Just now.

655
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,989
I spoke with the guards.

656
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,791
They found the cave,
but it was empty.

657
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,126
There was nothing
in there but blood.

658
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:58,497
Evidence of grave suffering,
but no monster.

659
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:00,966
If Olivia got away,
he surely knew we'd be coming.

660
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,234
Maybe that's why
he left Rowan's hand.

661
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,071
To draw us out onto the ice.

662
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,473
I'll find him.

663
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:11,810
I'll see him dead for Rowan
and for all his victims.

664
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:14,479
I promise you.

665
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,847
You can go, assured of that.

666
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:20,851
You deserve your own
life far away from here.

667
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:25,923
Maybe finally I can find
something that's... my own.

668
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:28,826
You will.

669
00:32:29,928 --> 00:32:31,996
You'll still be my brother.

670
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:35,833
Francis?

671
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:40,604
Why did you release
Sebastian from the dungeon?

672
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,172
I just needed his help.

673
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:47,344
Well, now that he's here, we need
to finish this once and for all.

674
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:49,078
Finish what?

675
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,398
Bash, when I told you
to forget about Mary,

676
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,484
I hoped you would listen to me.

677
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,719
When I forced you to watch
their consummation,

678
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,322
my message was the same,

679
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:02,159
but when I looked into your eyes
that night, I saw the truth.

680
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,962
You will always covet
what your brother has.

681
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:13,235
Father, did you speak to my
guards the night that Bash left?

682
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:16,438
Did you order his execution?

683
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,574
Sacrifices must be made.

684
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:22,044
What has happened to you,
Father? Have you lost all sense?

685
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:24,029
Do not question me!
Mark my words,

686
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,747
he would strike you down
to take what is yours.

687
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:28,417
If he is a threat to you, then
he is a threat to everything I want.

688
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:31,787
FRANCIS: He's your son. Scotland,
England, a peaceful France.

689
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:33,656
Father, stop this! Father...

690
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:35,924
He's leaving! He's leaving
for Spain tonight.

691
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:38,393
He's said that before,
and he's still here.

692
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:41,063
You refuse to let Mary go.

693
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,731
You haven't listened to your king.

694
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:44,733
When people don't listen
to their king,

695
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:48,570
when they've wax in their ears,
drastic measures are needed.

696
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:49,971
Father, you're wrong.

697
00:33:49,972 --> 00:33:52,340
He has let her go.
He saved my life today.

698
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:54,642
Don't get sentimental.

699
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:57,812
You must cut down any threat...

700
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:59,980
like a weed.

701
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:01,416
No. I've just explained to you.

702
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:04,286
Your son is a friend to your realm.

703
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:05,987
BASH: Francis, don't anger him.

704
00:34:05,988 --> 00:34:08,656
FRANCIS: He saved your heir's
life, and pursued your enemies.

705
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:15,096
If you harm this man...
your son, you harm yourself.

706
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,631
Do you hear me?

707
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:21,769
(gasps)

708
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,348
I am pleased to see you
two getting along again.

709
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:36,483
(panting)

710
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:40,787
I know just the thing to preserve
this lovely harmony.

711
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:46,626
If it doesn't work,

712
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:49,662
this sword will take
two lives tonight.

713
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:01,160
(loon calling)

714
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,695
(footfalls approaching)

715
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,602
(loon calling)

716
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:16,007
The last person I danced with...

717
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:18,809
was my wife.

718
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,379
I was married once.

719
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,464
I had... little children,

720
00:35:24,465 --> 00:35:26,485
so young, so sweet.

721
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,787
In the mornings
when-when I wake up,

722
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:32,056
sometimes I'm-I'm still there,

723
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:35,193
lying in that bed...

724
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:37,528
with my wife beside me,

725
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:41,966
the little ones whispering, laughing.

726
00:35:44,203 --> 00:35:46,536
When the plague came,

727
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:49,740
I alone was immune.

728
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:54,078
I couldn't save them.

729
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:59,349
I'm so sorry.

730
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,851
This is why you dedicate
yourself to your work?

731
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,086
To saving others?

732
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,225
You must know...

733
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:11,543
you saved me.

Is it done?

749
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:08,883
Well, Penelope,

750
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:11,085
I must say, I'm impressed.

751
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,988
Ah, there she is,

752
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:17,392
my lovely queen.

753
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,498
(moaning)

754
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:25,099
Now, Catherine,

755
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,602
Penelope tells me you demanded
she pour that vial into my wine.

756
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:31,471
She threatened my life if
I failed to give it to you.

757
00:37:31,472 --> 00:37:32,740
I did no such thing.

758
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:34,575
Are you calling my queen a liar?

759
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,010
(laughing): This is nonsense.

760
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:37,611
She's a servant girl.

761
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:41,081
You're not well.
She's taking advantage.

762
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:43,283
I have never felt better in my life.

763
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:45,619
I'm in love, Catherine.

764
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,986
I'm in love with Queen Penelope.

765
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:49,590
Hmm. She's not a queen!

766
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:52,759
She didn't even win
that ridiculous contest.

767
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,194
In the kitchen,
they say that she slept

768
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:56,430
with the pastry chef
to get the bean.

769
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:59,099
Penelope, my crown. Now.

770
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,800
(laughs) Give it to me.

771
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:03,837
Listen. Carefully.

772
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,540
If you utter one more insult to my queen,
if you try to harm her in any way,

773
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:10,910
I will have you drawn and quartered
and your limbs fed to lions.

774
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:14,492
And those you love
shall suffer worse fates.

775
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,784
(gasping) (laughing)

776
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:20,886
PENELOPE (echoing):
It was poison, wasn't it?

777
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:22,221
What?

778
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:23,822
What are you talking about?

779
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:25,958
(echoing): I wanted to
teach you a lesson.

780
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:30,129
So I had the contents of that
vial emptied into your wine.

781
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,631
You don't look well, darling.

782
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:33,565
Henry.

783
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:36,068
(sighs)

784
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:41,273
I wanted to thank you, Catherine,
for teaching me to think long-term.

785
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:44,843
(mutters)

786
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:47,712
(gasping)

787
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:49,414
(panting)

788
00:38:49,415 --> 00:38:51,783
- Oh, Mary.
- What's happened? Are you all right?

789
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:53,818
Mary, find Nostradamus.
Henry's drugged me.

790
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:55,353
(gasps)

791
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:57,756
Catherine? Catherine!

792
00:38:57,757 --> 00:39:00,024
Guards! (sighs)

793
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:02,093
How is she?

794
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:04,785
Nostradamus is treating her now.

795
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:07,899
She fell into some sort of drugged
sleep, but she's coming out of it.

796
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm going to talk to my father.

797
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:11,602
Francis, wait. Your father...

798
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:13,771
- he's not well.
- I am aware of that.

799
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:17,175
He got so angry at Bash that I
thought he'd take his head off.

800
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:18,375
He might kill him yet.

801
00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:22,078
What happened?

802
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,781
Did Father forgive you?

803
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:25,081
BASH: Not exactly.

804
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:28,018
But he illuminated
me on his solution.

805
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,753
It's a bit of a
horror show, actually.

806
00:39:29,754 --> 00:39:32,022
And you're both invited. Now.

807
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:34,157
On pain of death.

808
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:39,296
MAN: And so, under
the eyes of the Lord,

809
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:42,532
we prepare to consecrate
this blessed union

810
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:45,053
with two sacred oaths.

811
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:47,470
- You want me to say an oath?
- What about your oath?

812
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,973
You promised me someone
with a title!

813
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:55,978
Fine. Bash, I hereby declare you
the Master of Horse and Hunt.

814
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,647
What does that even mean?!

815
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:58,781
Shut up and say the words.

816
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:00,416
KENNA: Please.

817
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:02,117
This is marriage.
It can't be undone...

818
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:04,587
Say the words!

819
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,825
I, Sebastian,

820
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:11,593
take this woman to be my
lawful wife... (Kenna cries)

821
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:16,598
under the eyes of God,
from this day forward.

822
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:24,772
Take a dozen men each morning
and canvass the woods.

823
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:26,341
Any pagan found with knowledge of

824
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:28,277
the Darkness will be brought
to me for questioning.

825
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:31,312
- I don't take orders from bastards.
- Haven't you heard?

826
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:33,982
I've been titled
Master of Horse and Hunt. So,

827
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:37,051
gather your horses
and go out and hunt.

828
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:40,889
(sighs)

829
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,628
Are you all right?

830
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:53,101
Well, I'm married to someone
I don't much like.

831
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:55,270
And I have to stay here

832
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:58,006
and watch you love someone else
for the rest of my life.

833
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:01,876
Bash, you told me that
your feelings for me were gone.

834
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:04,678
I lied.

835
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,810
You were right. I should
never have come back.

836
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:13,211
